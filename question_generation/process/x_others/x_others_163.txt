In the days that followed , a record number of volunteers flooded disaster response agencies , government agencies , churches and local outreach organizations with calls to find out how they could help . I was one of those volunteers and what I experienced changed my life forever . <p> Three years later , much of the region remains abandoned . Repair of city infrastructure and tourism ( the primary economic source for this part of the nation ) are slow and stagnant in much of the region . We will be successful in turning around these trends only if we come together and rededicate ourselves to this effort . As part of the Black Googlers Network ( BGN ) , 32 colleagues and I traveled to the region for what was initially slated as a Katrina Rebuilding Outreach Trip . As New Orleans slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by side with the proud and resilient residents of this amazing city to help them repair the lives they 've worked so hard to rebuild , sending a clear message that they are not forgotten . <p> As our group planned to deploy so quickly after Hurricane Gustav , most agencies were still shut down because their employees were evacuated to other parts of the country . Notable exceptions to this shut down were two organizations to which I have personal ties - St. Bernard Project and The Idea Village . <p> St. Bernard Project is a nonprofit , community-based organization that began rebuilding homes in August 2006 ( boasting 177 projects to date ) that were damaged by flood waters from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in St. Bernard Parish , Louisiana . St. Bernard Parish is a working class community and was one of the hardest hit parishes of the city because of its location just 5 miles from the now infamous Industrial Levee . <p> The Idea Village is an organization working to accelerate the growth of the entrepreneurial community in the embattled New Orleans region . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launch plan for their 504ward $200,000 business plan competition by employing our business savvy , creative thought processes and Google product knowledge . Launched on September 25th , this competition hopes to keep the thousands of young people who have flocked to New Orleans since Katrina engaged by soliciting ideas on how to develop a strong foundation of entrepreneurial ventures . The Idea Village 's motto is " Trust Your Crazy Ideas , " but I do n't see anything crazy about wanting to rebuild one of America 's greatest cities . <p> The highlight of the trip was that at each build site , the families whose homes we were returning to their former grace stopped by to say hello , offer their gratitude and recount the stories of survival . Andrea was the owner of the home I was rebuilding . She was the mother of two small children and was anxious to return a sense of normalcy to all of their lives . Andrea told us of the time her adventurous son wandered into the deep grass behind her home only to come face to face with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiously inspected the snake , only to be whisked up by his attentive mother just as the serpent was preparing to strike . This snake 's venom could kill a full grown man in 20 minutes . The closest emergency room , as a result the devastation , is over 45 minutes away . Even with all of the progress made to get people back into their homes , communities are fractured and without basic services and business opportunities . <p> On the final day of our trip , we went to the Upper and Lower Ninth Ward , the areas most devastated by the hurricanes . The neighborhoods were absent of life ; there is little or nothing for residents to come back to . But signs of hope included children riding bikes , families and neighbors barbecuing on the front lawns of their homes ( many still tattooed with the post storm FEMA markings ) and a few bold projects such as the The Musicians ' Village and Brad Pitt 's Make it Right project . These things remind me not to view New Orleans with sadness or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer a hand in their greatest time of need . In our case , 64 hands .
