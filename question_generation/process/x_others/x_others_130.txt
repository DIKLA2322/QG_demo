In collaboration with Wangari Maathais Green Belt Movement and several other partners , the Google Earth Outreach team has created several narrated tours on the topic of climate change in preparation for the UNFCCCs COP16 Climate Summit 2010 in Cancun , Mexico . Fly underwater to learn about the effects of ocean acidification on sea life with Oceana . Zoom around Mexican mangroves in 3D and learn about the importance of this biodiverse habitat ... and what must be done to protect it for future generations . Visit **42;498;TOOLONG to experience these tours . -Ed . <p> Ask most people what trees mean to them and the first thing that comes to mind is the tree outside their bedroom window or the forest where they played as a child . Trees do occupy a powerful place in our emotions , but the most powerful argument to protect our worlds trees is not based on sentiment . There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for survival . Trees are our watersheds , protectors of the natural environment , and sources of food . Remove the trees from the equation and the community feels the impact . <p> I came to this realization in the 1970s in Kenya . I was talking to women in my community about their problems : hunger , access to water , poverty , wood fuel . I saw a link between their needs and the condition of the land and thought , " Why not plant trees to address these issues ? " Trees hold the soil to the ground so that we can grow food in it , they protect watersheds and facilitate harvesting of rain water , fruits trees supplement food and trees give us domestic energy and wood with which to build our shelters . So while still working at the University of Nairobi , I established a tree nursery in my backyard , planted seven trees at a public park and founded the Green Belt Movement . The organization works to empower communities , to build their capacity to restore Africa 's forests and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of environmental degradation cause . As a result of this idea , more than 40 million trees have been planted to restore the environment and improve the lives of the people who are linked to the land . <p> When we were offered a unique opportunity to partner with the Google Earth Outreach team on a project using new Google Earth technology to visualize trees in 3D , we were thrilled . For accuracy and integrity we worked very closely with Google , advising them on the modeling of unique African trees like the broad-leaved Croton , the Nile tulip tree and the East African Cordia . These tree models illustrate the biodiversity in our tree planting sites , especially in the forests , and how we carefully select trees that are indigenous and sustainable to the natural surroundings . <p> Broad-leaved Croton , the Nile tulip tree and the East African Cordia ( from left to right ) <p> We then used data from real planting locations to " plant " the tree models in Google Earth and create 3D visualizations . Now , for the first time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to virtually visit these planting sites , explore the 3D trees and connect with the work that we are doing . <p> Green Belt Movement planting site in 3D on Google Earth <p> Tree planting is a simple activity with tangible results , and anyone can participate . It helps people come together to address common problems and work collectively towards community improvement and sustainability . I hope that seeing our beautiful tree planting sites in 3D on Google Earth will be a source of inspiration for people to engage , plant trees and organize planting activities in their own communities . Taking charge of our lives and the environment around us can help ensure a lasting legacy and healthy future for our children .
