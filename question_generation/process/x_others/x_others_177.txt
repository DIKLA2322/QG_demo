Our hearts go out to those who have been affected by this devastation and were deeply grateful to those who are working to keep us safe .

Ninety-three percent of mobile users in Japan do n't  have top-of-the-line smartphones , so weve recently optimized this Crisis Response page to make it more readable for a wider range of devices . You can also access that version by scanning this QR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earthquake , we launched Person Finder so people can enter the names of those they 're looking for or have found .

Were also constantly updating a master map ( in Japanese and English ) with other data such as epicenter locations and evacuation shelters . And with information from the newspaper Mainichi , we 've published a partial list of shelters . <p> TranslationUse Google Translate for Japanese and 56 other languages .
