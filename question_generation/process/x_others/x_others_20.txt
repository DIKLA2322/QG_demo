We need a new energy blueprint for the futurethe latest advances in technology have the potential to bring us closer to that goal than ever before . <p> That 's why Im pleased to welcome Dr. Arun Majumdar to Google , where he will drive Google.orgs energy initiatives and advise the company on our broader energy strategy . Arun is widely recognized as one of the foremost leaders in energy innovation . He joins us from the Department of Energy , where he served as Acting Undersecretary of Energy and was founding Director of the Advanced Research Projects AgencyEnergy ( better known as ARPA-E ) , identifying and providing essential support for the development of transformational new energy technologies . In his roles at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California at Berkeley , he made great contributions in the areas of energy conversion , transport , and storage , and in 2005 was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Aruns leadership and experience on the team .

Every time I return from the region , I am energized by the dynamism of the young people I meet but overwhelmed by the challenges the region faces . The combination of high oil and food prices affects the United States economy , to be sure , but the impact on poor people in poor countries is exponentially greater . People have to make hard decisions like taking their children out of school , rationing the little food they have , and in some cases not eating at all . High fuel prices also contribute to lower uses of fertilizer , resulting in lower agricultural yields . The cycle spirals in a way that hurts the poorest people the most . <p> And yet there is another story unfolding simultaneously in Eastern Africa . It is the story of Safaricom , the most successful telecom company on the continent . Safaricom started trading publicly on the Nairobi stock exchange in June and catalyzed the largest IPO on the continent ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all walks of life , resulting in an over-subscription of stock of more than 400% . Mobile is growing faster in Africa than in any other part of the world . While levels of internet penetration are well below 5% for the continent , nearly 40% have access to mobile phones and Nairobi sends more text messages in a single day than New York ( a statistic frequently quoted in the region ) . <p> Ten years ago people were talking about land lines and how they would ever penetrate rural Africa . Infrastructure has long been a constraint on economic development and growth in Africa but nobody imagined that a new technology would completely leap-frog the traditional phone and fundamentally disrupt telephony in Africa . I ca n't help but think about rural energy in the same light . Today , countries like Uganda are still 90% unserved by electricity . Can you imagine not having power in 90% of any country and still trying to grow the economy ? Do we expect Africans to wait for grid electricity to incrementally reach people or are there disruptive innovations that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways ? What would this look like given large geo-thermal and bio-diesel reserves in East Africa and can renewable energy sources provide opportunities for greener solutions in Africa ? <p> Interacting with dynamic and bright Africans under 30 ( who make up 70% or more of most African countries ) , I can not help but wonder what is on the horizon . People are innovating all over the continent with bio-gas , small scale hydro , wind , and solar power . Where people have electricity , there is a massive difference in economic activity , public services , productivity , and hope about the future . Energy is truly a platform that affects nearly every aspect of rural life . Today , Africa is mostly unserved by power grids but given innovation possibilities , are there not scalable ways to introduce renewable energy to millions of people who are completely unplugged from the global economy today ?

We talked about our vision to use strengths of Google in information and technology to build products and advocate for critical policies that address global challenges . Ideas for projects continue to pour in from Googlers and partners around the globe , and we 're incubating several new projects in the areas of economic development , clean energy and access to technology . <p> Introduced Earth Engine , a new computational platform we have begun building for global-scale analysis of satellite imagery to monitor changes in key environmental indicators like forest coverage , at COP15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chile , with maps , updated earth imagery , and networking projects , and built Person Finder to help people find information about their loved ones after a disaster . <p> Advocated for policies to spur innovation of renewable energy technologies that are cheaper than coal ( RE&lt;C ) , and our engineers worked on ways to reduce the cost of solar thermal and other RE&lt;C technologies . <p> We will continue to greenlight large scale engineering projects that build on Google 's strengths in technology , our computing infrastructure and global teams . <p> Overall , our philanthropic mission at Google includes our Google.org projects and a range of other initiatives - from grants , scholarships and other charitable giving programs to in-kind product support for non-profits . Our founders have set a goal of devoting approximately 1% of Google 's equity and yearly profits to philanthropy . In 2009 , we devoted around $100 million plus in-kind giving to a broad range of philanthropic efforts . Here are some highlights : <p> Academic scholarships and awards : We provide scholarships to encourage students of various backgrounds , ethnicities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these and other programs will help dismantle barriers that keep women and minorities from entering computing and technology fields . <p> Academic grants : We support the next generation of engineers and maintain strong ties with academic institutions worldwide that are pursuing research in core areas relevant to our mission . We fund projects across a variety of subjects , host visiting faculty members at Google , and have launched the Google Fellowship Program to fund graduate students doing innovative research in several fields . <p> Holiday charitable gift : We made $22 million in donations in 2009 to a couple of dozen deserving charities around the world to help organizations that have been stretched thin by more requests for help in a year of fewer donations . <p> Employee gift matching : Google matches up to $6,000 for each employee 's annual charitable contributions and contributes $50 for every five hours an employee volunteers through our " Dollars for Doers " program to encourage employee participation in charitable causes . <p> Charitable Giving Council : We support grants for Googler-led partnerships on causes such as K-12 educational initiatives in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We invest in communities where Google has a presence around the world , creating opportunities for Googlers to invest time and expertise , engage in local grant making and build partnerships with local stakeholders . <p> In addition , our Google for Non-Profits site provides information and links to free tools to help charitable groups promote their cause , raise money , collaborate with others and operate more efficiently . Google Grants , for example , offers in-kind AdWords advertising to non-profit organizations . Since the program began , we 've donated over $625 million worth of AdWords advertising to all kinds of charitable organizations .
