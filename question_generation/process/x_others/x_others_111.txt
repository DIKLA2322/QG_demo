@@13269004 @1869004/ <h> Wednesday 6/29/2011 09:58:00 AM <p> Last week , the Google Earth Outreach and Google.org teams , in collaboration with the Global Canopy Programme , hosted partners from non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) for the first gathering of the Community Forest Monitoring Working Group . The goals of the working group are to provide a platform for groups engaged in community forest monitoring activities - across continents - to share knowledge and experience . Equally important is for these groups to provide recommendations for the development of tools , methodologies , and common protocols . For example , the Surui tribe in the Brazilian Amazon is using modern technology to implement their communitys Surui Carbon Project . <p> This effort is n't isolated , as many NGOs and stakeholders support community-based approaches to forest monitoring for their efficiency , cultural relevance , and reliability . Community Forest Monitoring will play a role in the United Nations Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation ( REDD+ ) effort which aims to incentivize developing countries to adopt a low-emission path to development . In thinking about best methods for data collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection issues including usability , security , accountability , cultural relevance , and scalability . <p> These are all concerns that the team at Open Data Kit ( ODK ) , an open source suite of data collection tools , have fleshed out and iterated upon . ODK was born in 2008 as a Google sabbatical project of University of Washington computer science professor Gaetano Borriello . Borriello wanted to take advantage of Googles data collection tools : maps , visualization , databases and has said that his team saw a gap in mobile data collection . Thus , Borriellos team developed ODK Build , ODK Collect , and ODK Aggregate , mobile tools that have attracted thousands of users and dozens of active developers . <p> As ODK iterates and evolves , the Public Sector Engineering team is learning about the challenges and opportunities in mobile data collection and exploring how we can contribute to this space . ODK already gives users the option to visualize data in Google Earth and Google Fusion Tables , and we are exploring how to take advantage of some of Googles other tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily posted to Picasa , or videos to YouTube ? ) Its our goal to make sure that all meaningful data is effectively organized and made discoverable , accessible and usable . <p> Ultimately , community forest monitoring represents just one slice of the potential that effective data collection tools create . ODK was initially motivated by the needs of community health workers and has proven flexible enough to be used to track everything from human rights violations in the Central African Republic to water quality in Ghana . As the nature of scientific research diversifies and the volume of data collected increases , reliable , flexible , and lightweight tools will become more and more crucial . <p> What 's next ? As the engineering teams continue to work on improving mobile data collection tools , this working group will convene policymakers at the next workshop to discuss standards and best practices . " The greatest barrier is n't a technological one , but the challenge of leveraging this data so that communities can help ensure better governance for their forests , " says Niki Mardas , Head of Strategy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with many other public data collection efforts , it will become the job of advocates and analysts to shape meaningful narratives and press for the change the world needs . We 're proud to be playing a part in this effort and we 're committed to working with our partners to transform data collection from a passive , closed process into an active and empowering one . <h> Tuesday 6/28/2011 07:00:00 AM <p> At Google , were committed to using technology to solve one of the greatest challenges we face as a country : building a clean energy future . That 's why we 've worked hard to be carbon neutral as a company , launched our renewable energy cheaper than coal initiative and have invested in several clean energy companies and projects around the world . <p> But what if we knew the value of innovation in clean energy technologies ? How much could new technologies contribute to our economic growth , enhance our energy security or reduce greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions ? Robust data can help us understand these important questions , and the role innovation in clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and climate challenges . <p> Through Google.org , our energy team set out to answer some of these questions . Using McKinseys Low Carbon Economics Tool ( LCET ) , we assessed the long-term economic impacts for the U.S. assuming breakthroughs were made in several different clean energy technologies , like wind , geothermal and electric vehicles . McKinseys LCET is a neutral , analytic set of interlinked models that estimates the potential economic and technology implications of various policy and technology assumptions . <p> The analysis is based on a model and includes assumptions and conclusions that Google.org developed , so it is n't a prediction of the future . Weve decided to make the analysis and associated data available everywhere because we believe it could provide a new perspective on the economic value of public and private investment in energy innovation . Here are just some of the most compelling findings : <p> Energy innovation pays off big : We compared " business as usual " ( BAU ) to scenarios with breakthroughs in clean energy technologies . On top of those , we layered a series of possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We found that by 2030 , when compared to BAU , breakthroughs could help the U.S. : <p> Reduce U.S. total carbon emissions by 13% in 2030 ( 21% with Clean Policy ) <p> Speed matters and delay is costly : Our model found a mere five year delay ( 2010-2015 ) in accelerating technology innovation led to $2.3-3.2 trillion in unrealized GDP , an aggregate 1.2-1.4 million net unrealized jobs and 8-28 more gigatons of potential GHG emissions by 2050 . <p> Policy and innovation can enhance each other : Combining clean energy policies with technological breakthroughs increased the economic , security and pollution benefits for either innovation or policy alone . Take GHG emissions : the model showed that combining policy and innovation led to 59% GHG reductions by 2050 ( vs. 2005 levels ) , while maintaining economic growth . <p> This analysis assumed that breakthroughs in clean energy happened and that policies were put in place , and then tried to understand the impact . The data here allows us to imagine a world in which the U.S. captures the potential benefits of some clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction in harmful emissions . We have n't developed the roadmap , and getting there will take the right mix of policies , sustained investment in technological innovation by public and private institutions and mobilization of the private sectors entrepreneurial energies . We hope this analysis encourages further discussion and debate on these important issues . <h> Monday 6/20/2011 11:53:00 AM <p> Earlier this month , thousands of " hackers for good " gathered in more than 19 different global locationsfrom Berlin to Nairobi , and Sydney to Sao Pauloto participate in Random Hacks of Kindness #3 . These teams are now off and running , working with NGO and government advisors to finish their applications for humanity . <p> In partnership with Microsoft , Yahoo ! , NASA and the World Bank , we founded RHoK in 2009 to build and support a community creating open source technology for crisis response . At RHoK #3 , we expanded the mandate to include climate change , and we also recently announced that were broadening the scope in the future to tackle any development challenges . <p> Of the more than 75 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many are already on their way to making a difference around the world . The UN , in partnership with the Colombia government , is considering adopting the shelter management system developed at RHoK Bogota to aid the 3 million victims of winter flooding in South America . Of the nine hacks submitted for judging at RHoK Sao Paulo , two are already in use and two others may be further developed and incorporated into the restructuring of the National Weather Service . The winning application at RHoK Philadelphia , developed in response to a problem proposed by the World Bank Water group , is set for further development at the WaterHackathon , RHoK 's first community-sponsored event , later this year . <p> At the RHoK Silicon Valley event at Googles Mountain View campus , we selected three winners : <p> SMS Person Finder enables anyone with a phone to interact with Person Finder , a software application that Google built to help people connect with their loved ones following a disaster . The Google Crisis Response team is working with this group to integrate their application into future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for people to reuse and recycle items by setting up email alerts when free items that they 're looking for are entered on freecycle.org <p> Were proud to be one of the founding partners and ongoing sponsors of Random Hacks of Kindness and look forward to seeing these application make a difference . Stay tuned for future RHoK events , and follow the progress of the community at RHoK.org.
