@@13269086 @1869086/ <h> Thursday 9/09/2010 06:06:00 PM <p> Official data on the number of people still lacking access to adequate water and sanitation services prove that the current situation is simply unacceptable : 884 million people lack adequate access to clean water and 2.6 billion lack access to proper sanitation , according to the WHO and UNICEFs Joint Water Monitoring Program . Disease spreads rapidly with over one billion people forced to defecate outside due to a lack of sanitation and indoor plumbing ; in fact , unsafe water and sanitation is the most important environmental cause of ill-health , with millions dying every year as a result of poor water , sanitation and hygiene conditions . Young children in particular tend to suffer from water-borne diseases such as diarrhoea . <p> Success in water supply and sanitation interventions is commonly measured in terms of the number of wells dug , public water points connected or public toilets constructed . This is what the official data - available at national scale only - reflect . The assumption is that every water point and every toilet will provide adequate and sustainable services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , wells run dry , hand pumps break , toilets go " out-of-service , " or the quality of the water provided is not safe . <p> As a result the official data seriously underestimate the water and sanitation crisis . A realistic assessment requires continuous monitoring at local levels . Modern technology now makes that possible . <p> The H2.0group of partners set out to demonstrate that community level monitoring of operational water and sanitation services is feasible at national scales . Google.org is one of the H2.0 partners . We have co-funded the effort and provided technical support . Yesterday the group launched the H2.0 platform at a World Water Week event in Stockholm . Over the past several years , the partners have collected detailed water and sanitation service data and developed a data management and mapping platform . This platform will enable users open access to analyse , visualise and interact with the data . We want to support government and development partners prioritize water investments and help NGOs and service providers assess their performance in a transparent manner . <p> Three components of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that the number of people with access to safe and affordable water is significantly lower than official estimates have previously shown : <p> For Kenya , the initial analysis of data collected by the Water Services Trust Fund shows , according to Han Seur of GTZ , that : " In over a thousand low income urban areas with a total population over 4.5 million less than 25% have access to safe and affordable water . " <p> For TanzaniaWaterAid and partners mapped over 25 thousand rural public water points in 2006 . Vincent Casey of WaterAid summarized their report as : " Water point data mapped by WaterAid Tanzania has demonstrated that nearly half ( 46% ) of rural water points are not functional . A quarter of all new water points are no longer working just two years after installation . " <p> For Zanzibar , according to Graham Alabaster of UN-Habitat : " Counting only those who are paying less 10% of their income for water as having affordable access , the water access rate had to be revised from 90% down to 22% . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis is affecting two to three times more people in the areas surveyed than the official data suggest . <p> Better data on water services can help consumers hold their water service provider accountable . H2.0 partner ITC developed the Human Sensor Web , a system that allows Zanzibar citizens to report water outages by SMS and receive alert messages on water quality and availability . <p> To understand the issue and invest in solutions that work , we need to stop measuring success as construction of taps and toilets , and start measuring success by monitoring the number of people with sustainable access to safe and affordable water and sanitation services .
