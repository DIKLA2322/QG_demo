@@13269059 @1869059/ <h> Thursday 12/17/2009 06:38:00 PM <p> ( Cross-posted from the Official Google Blog to bring you information on other green efforts at Google ) <p> As leaders from around the world meet in Copenhagen to address global climate change this month , we thought it was a good time to reflect on our own carbon footprint . In 2007 , we committed to become a carbon neutral company . We know that it is n't possible to write a check and eliminate the environmental impact of our operations . So what does " carbon neutrality " mean to us ? <p> First , we aggressively pursue reductions in our energy consumption through energy efficiency , innovative infrastructure design and operations and on-site renewable energy . Our Google designed data centers use half the energy of typical facilities . We 're also working to accelerate the development of economic , clean renewable energy at scale through research and development , investment and policy outreach . At this time , however , such efforts do n't cover our entire carbon footprint . Therefore , since 2007 we 've gone a step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cover the portion of our footprint that we can not yet eliminate which is what we mean by " carbon neutrality . " <p> So what exactly is a carbon offset ? The idea behind an offset is that we pay someone to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in a specific , measurable way , thus offseting an equal climate impact on our side . To determine our impact , we calculate our annual carbon footprint , which is then verified by an independent third party . We include direct energy consumption ( like natural gas ) and electricity use , employee commuting , company vehicle use , business travel and estimates of carbon emissions from building construction and from the manufacturing of servers used in our datacenters . We then buy an equivalent number of carbon offsets . <p> While carbon offsets seem simple in principle , in practice they are surprisingly complicated . In particular , it 's often difficult to say whether or not the offset project results in emissions reductions that would have happened anyway . We find ourselves asking whether the project in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of offsets , this concept is referred to as " additionality . " Carbon offsets have a mixed reputation because some projects are not additional . Here at Google , we have set a very high bar to ensure that our investment makes an actual difference in reducing greenhouse gas emissions by purchasing offsets that are real , verifiable , permanent and additional . <p> To date , we have selected high quality carbon offsets from around the world that reduce greenhouse gas emissions ranging from landfill gas projects in Caldwell County , NC , and Steuben County , NY , to animal-waste management systems in Mexico and Brazil . Our funding helps make it possible for equipment to be installed that captures and destroys the methane gas produced as the waste decomposes . Methane , the primary component in natural gas , is a significant contributor to global warming . We chose to focus on landfill and agricultural methane reduction projects because methane 's impact on warming is very well understood , it 's easy to measure how much methane is captured and the capture would n't happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , they could n't make enough money selling the gas ) . <p> We need fundamental changes to global energy and transportation infrastructure to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions over the long term . In the meantime , the projects to which we contribute offer measurable emissions reductions and allow us to take responsibility for our carbon footprint . To that end , we 're always looking for good emissions-reduction projects to support . If you have a landfill gas or agricultural methane carbon offset project you think we should consider , please visit this page for more information about how to participate in our latest carbon-offset procurement round . <h> Wednesday 12/16/2009 02:37:00 PM <p> I 'm here in Copenhagen this week , at the COP15 International Climate Change Conference . Whether you 're attending in-person , or reading news headlines from home , you ca n't miss the fact that addressing climate change requires the world to solve a mind-boggling mix of science , policy and political issues . These are formidable challenges , but new technologies can help provide solutions for these complex problems . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been an accord to compensate countries for preserving forests and other natural landscapes that play a crucial role in reducing emissions . Implementation of the agreement , known as Reducing Emissions From Deforestation and Forest Degradation , or REDD , will require the ability to accurately track deforestation at a regional and global level . <p> Despite the widespread availability of global satellite imagery through products like Google Earth and Google Maps , it has n't been easy for tropical nations to understand the state of their ecosystem , and to quantitatively monitor changes in forest coverage or other key indicators . That 's why I 'm proud to announce a new computational platform for global-scale analysis of satellite imagery : Earth Engine , powered by Google . <p> At an event today hosted by Avoided Deforestation Partners , global leaders from the President of Guyana to the Prime Minister of Norway expressed their support for REDD . Earlier today , the U.S , Australia , France , Japan , Norway and Britain pledged $3.5 billion over the next three years to protect rainforests . At the event , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth Engine that we developed together with the Carnegie Institution for Science , IMAZON and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation . Traditional forest monitoring is complex and expensive , requiring access to large amounts of satellite data , lots of hard drives to hold the data , lots of computers to process the data , and lots of time while you wait for various computations to finish . Our prototype demonstrates how Earth Engine makes all of this easier , by moving everything into the cloud . Google supplies data , storage , and computing muscle . As a result , you can visualize forest change in fractions of a second over the web , instead of the minutes or hours that traditional offline systems require for such analysis . The prototype applications running on Earth Engine are n't yet available to the public , but you can see screen shots in our earlier blog post . <p> We want to ensure this technology is widely available when it 's ready , so today I formally announced Google.org 's commitment to provide our Earth Engine free to tropical countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is just the first of many Earth Engine applications that will help enable scientists , policymakers , and the general public to better monitor and understand the Earth 's ecosystems . <h> Tuesday 12/15/2009 09:39:00 AM <p> People often get up in settings like the international climate change conference in Copenhagen and make complicated pronouncements that leave heads spinning . Today was different . Google , GE , the Climate Group , and NRDC , supported by other leading businesses and NGOs , had a simple message : governments across the world should ensure people have real-time access to their home energy information . <p> Most of us know little about how we use energy in our homes , other than what our monthy power bill tells us . Yet studies show that when people can see in real-time how much energy they are using , they save up to 15% on their electricity use with simple behavioral changes , and even more with investments in energy efficiency . The savings are huge when added up : if all US households reduced 15% of their energy use by 2020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road and would save consumers $46 billion on their energy bills . <p> As 40,000 people gather in Copenhagen to fight global warming , we think that 's a solution that governments should be paying attention to . This group , which will take other actions after the meeting has ended , has begun a push to give ordinary citizens the tools to save money and save the planet . A lot of the decisions on the table in Copenhagen are hard , we believe this one is simple . <h> Thursday 12/10/2009 04:59:00 AM <p> Today , at the International Climate Change Conference ( COP15 ) in Copenhagen , we demonstrated a new technology prototype that enables online , global-scale observation and measurement of changes in the earth 's forests . We hope this technology will help stop the destruction of the world 's rapidly-disappearing forests . Emissions from tropical deforestation are comparable to the emissions of all of the European Union , and are greater than those of all cars , trucks , planes , ships and trains worldwide . According to the Stern Review , protecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cut carbon emissions and mitigate climate change . The United Nations has proposed a framework known as REDD ( Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries ) that would provide financial incentives to rainforest nations to protect their forests , in an effort to make forests worth " more alive than dead . " Implementing a global REDD system will require that each nation have the ability to accurately monitor and report the state of their forests over time , in a manner that is independently verifiable . However , many of these tropical nations of the world lack the technological resources to do this , so we 're working with scientists , governments and non-profits to change this . Here 's what we 've done with this prototype to help nations monitor their forests : <p> Start with satellite imagerySatellite imagery data can provide the foundation for measurement and monitoring of the world 's forests . For example , in Google Earth today , you can fly to Rondonia , Brazil and easily observe the advancement of deforestation over time , from 1975 to 2001 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of imagery data past , present and future is available all over the globe . Even so , while today you can view deforestation in Google Earth , until now there has n't been a way to measure it . <p> Then add scienceWith this technology , it 's now possible for scientists to analyze raw satellite imagery data and extract meaningful information about the world 's forests , such as locations and measurements of deforestation or even regeneration of a forest . In developing this prototype , we 've collaborated with Greg Asner of Carnegie Institution for Science , and Carlos Souza of Imazon . Greg and Carlos are both at the cutting edge of forest science and have developed software that creates forest cover and deforestation maps from satellite imagery . Organizations across Latin America use Greg 's program , Carnegie Landsat Analysis System ( CLASlite ) , and Carlos ' program , Sistema de Alerta de Deforestation ( SAD ) , to analyze forest cover change . However , widespread use of this analysis has been hampered by lack of access to satellite imagery data and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloudWhat if we could offer scientists and tropical nations access to a high-performance satellite imagery-processing engine running online , in the " Google cloud " ? And what if we could gather together all of the earths raw satellite imagery data petabytes of historical , present and future data and make it easily available on this platform ? We decided to find out , by working with Greg and Carlos to re-implement their software online , on top of a prototype platform we 've built that gives them easy access to terabytes of satellite imagery and thousands of computers in our data centers . <p> Here are the results of running CLASlite on the satellite imagery sequence shown above : <p> CLASlite online - This shows deforestation and degradation in Rondonia , Brazil from 1986-2008 , with the red indicating recent activity <p> Here 's the result of running SAD in a region of recent deforestation pressure in Mato Grosso , Brazil : <p> SAD online - The red " hotspots " indicate deforestation that has happened within the last 30 days <p> Combining science with massive data and technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unprecedented speed : On a top-of-the-line desktop computer , it can take days or weeks to analyze deforestation over the Amazon . Using our cloud-based computing power , we can reduce that time to seconds . Being able to detect illegal logging activities faster can help support local law enforcement and prevent further deforestation from happening . <p> Ease of use and lower costs : An online platform that offers easy access to data , scientific algorithms and computation horsepower from any web browser can dramatically lower the cost and complexity for tropical nations to monitor their forests . <p> Security , privacy and transparency : Governments and researchers do n't want to share sensitive data and results before they are ready . Our cloud-based platform allows users to control access to their data and results . At the same time , because the data , analysis and results reside online , they can also be easily shared , made available for collaboration , presented to the public and independently verified when appropriate . <p> Climate change impact : We think that a suitably scaled-up and enhanced version of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitoring , reporting and verification ( MRV ) in support of efforts such as REDD . <p> As a Google.org product , this technology will be provided to the world as a not-for-profit service . This technology prototype is currently available to a small set of partners for testing purposes it 's not yet available to the general public but we expect to make it more broadly available over the next year . We are grateful to a host of individuals and organizations ( find full list here ) who have advised us on developing this technology . In particular , we would like to thank the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation for their close partnership since the initial inception of this project . The goal of the Moore Foundations Environmental Conservation Program is to change the ways in which people use important terrestrial and coastal marine ecosystems to conserve critical ecological systems and functions , while allowing sustainable use . We 're also working with the Group on Earth Observations ( GEO ) , a consortium of national government bodies , inter-governmental organizations , space agencies and research institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force . Last month together we launched the GEO FCT portal and are now exploring how we can also together bring the power of this new technology to tropical nations . <p> We 're excited to be able to share this early prototype and look forward to seeing what 's possible . <h> Tuesday 12/08/2009 11:22:00 AM <p> Last Monday , we hosted experts from the U.S. Department of Energy , MIT , Stanford , UC Berkeley , Nth Power and Google for a discussion on clean energy innovation in our San Francisco office . The panelists focused on the important role innovation plays in seizing the economic benefits of developing and deploying cost-effective low carbon technologies . <p> These policies , if adopted and supported , will help us at last put in place what has been lacking in terms of clean energy innovation : a robust pipeline extending from basic research to applied research to demonstration projects to commercial scale-up to full deployment . At Google , we call this cycle " Lightbulbs to Lightbulbs " -- from the initial " lightbulb moment " of invention to full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the whole process . Ignoring any of these steps can inhibit the effectiveness of the whole innovation cycle . <p> Watch the full event here : <p> With equal measures of smart policy , investment and will , we can realize the great role clean energy innovation can play to solving climate change and boosting the American economy . <h> Wednesday 12/02/2009 11:06:00 AM <p> Today Governor Schwarzenegger and the California Natural Resources Agency is announcing CalAdapt , a new Google Earth-based tool designed to help Californians learn more about climate impacts and adaptation . The Stockholm Environmental Institute ( SEI ) helped develop the CalAdapt prototype with support from the California Energy Commission and Google.org . SEI has been a leader in developing an international network of interactive climate adaptation tools , as you can see at WeAdapt . CalAdapt is still in Beta , but the goal for this interactive tool is to bring science to the people . <p> And California has the science . The California Climate Change Center is one of the few state-funded climate research programs in the country . The Center has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resource managers in a series of state-wide climate assessments . <p> Do n't miss Gov . Schwarzenegger 's narrated Google Earth tour , which shows the risks of continued climate change for Californians and the important actions state and local agencies are taking to address these . See the short video version below ( and the longer one here ) or download the full tour for Google Earth here . You can learn more about California 's response in its Climate Adaptation Strategy , which was also released today . <p> We 're pleased to see California 's continued leadership in addressing climate change . <h> Tuesday 12/01/2009 02:48:00 PM <p> HIV/AIDS has cut a swath of destruction across the globeinfecting more than 60 million people , leaving 14 million orphans in sub-Saharan Africa alone . But a global movement to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS , along with scientific breakthroughs in treatment , have reversed the momentum in recent years . For those living with HIV in Africa , just two pills at 40 cents a day can bring a recovery so miraculous its known as the Lazarus Effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Thanks to the efforts of The Global Fund and other organizations around the globe , the number of people in low and middle-income countries receiving these medicines has increased ten-fold over 5 years . But fewer than half of those in need of treatment have access . And the number of new HIV infections continues to outstrip the numbers on treatment : for every two people starting treatment , five become infected with the virus .
