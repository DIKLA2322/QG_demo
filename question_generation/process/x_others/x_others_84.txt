@@13268974 @1868974/ <h> Thursday 7/21/2011 12:06:00 PM <p> Since June of 2011 , Council Bluffs , Iowa and the surrounding area has experienced record flooding along the Missouri River . Google has a data center in Council Bluffs , along with many employees that live in the city and surrounding region . <p> Along with our neighbors , we watched with concern as the Missouri River rose to a level not seen in decades . We are grateful for the extraordinary work of the City of Council Bluffs , Pottawattamie County , the Army Corps of Engineers and others who kept the city and much of the surrounding region safe . Our hearts also go out to those who have lost homes and businesses to the rising waters . <p> We recently worked with our satellite provider , GeoEye , to acquire updated imagery of some of the affected area . This imagery is now available as a KML file and will be live in the Historical Imagery section of Google Earth in the coming days . We hope that it will be of use to emergency responders and the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( before and after ) <p> Area between Council Bluffs/Omaha and Blair , Nebraska ( before and after ) <p> You can access all the new imagery by downloading the KML file and opening in Google Earth . <h> 7/14/2011 08:52:00 AM <p> Media is an integral part of how people understand , access , and share information about the world around them . Communication channels including newspapers , television , blogs , and online videos have tremendous potential to empower and influence individuals across the globe . Yet , millions of people still face barriers that limit them from tapping into these resources . They are marginalized by political and economic situations and other limitations that deprive them of the full citizenship made possible by access to news , information , and connections to people outside of their immediate environments . That 's why were working with Ashoka to find and support the best , most innovative ideas out there that will help people around the world unlock the power of media and participate more fully in society . <p> Today marks the beginning of a new initiative run by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovations that will boost media access and participation globally : Citizen Media : A Global Innovation Competition . What do we mean by this ? Well , were waiting for you to tell us , but here are some initial ideas for what strong entries might hope to achieve : <p> Give voice to underserved , vulnerable populations , introducing them to media creation and distribution , and showcasing their messages <p> Equip journalists and publishers with tools or channels to report important news that otherwise gets missed <p> Nominate your idea or suggest another innovation starting today ! Submissions are due on September 14th , and finalists will be selected by a panel of expert judges including Michael Maness , VP of Journalism and Media Innovation at the Knight Foundation , Esther Wojcicki , Vice Chair for Creative Commons , and Jared Cohen , Director of Google Ideas . Then , Ashoka will invite the public to vote on four winners who will receive cash prizes of US $5,000 . Top qualifying entrants will also be considered for an Ashoka Fellowship complete with a living stipend , international recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To encourage a breadth of global applications , the competition is being launched in nine languages : Arabic , Mandarin , English , French , Indonesian , Japanese , Portuguese , Spanish , and Thai . <p> Were excited to see the ideas submitted to this competition and to help social entrepreneurs advance their innovations . <p> This competition is run by Ashoka with sponsorship from Google . Submit your idea on : http : **35;252;TOOLONG <h> 7/07/2011 11:54:00 PM <p> On July 9 , South Sudan will officially be independent , becoming Africas 54th state . <p> In anticipation of this significant development , the World Bank , UNOSAT , RCMRD , Satellite Sentinel Project and Google organized a South Sudan Community Mapping event in Nairobi on June 30 . This was the second in a series of mapping events intended to encourage local people to create accurate and detailed maps of South Sudan , to help them navigate their path to independence . There were over 100 attendees in the room , mostly Sudanese -- university students , humanitarian workers , journalists , developers , donors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also as far as Juba , the capital of South Sudan . <p> The lives of the South Sudanese are anchored to their history and land . The event started with the sharing of prayers , stories and songs , allowing each of us to visualize the rivers , sheep , roads , and people . Drawn from these songs , the mapping of South Sudan with Google Map Maker began . I was excited to see schools , roads , rivers , historical monuments , and cemeteries being mapped over cities such as Aweil , Boma , Bor , Malakal , Rumbek , Tonga , Torit , and more . <p> Community Mapping Event in Nairobi on June 30 , 2011 <p> Many were interested in health resource mapping which can dramatically impact the lives of their new countrymen . Every year in South Sudan about one in every seven children dies before the age of five ; the maternity mortality rate is one of the highest in the world , and only 30% of the population has access to health care . For Charles Mona , Director GIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quality health resource maps would be great tools for improved health care planning , resource allocation , advocacy , and also increased access to health services for the local population . This is only one example of how accurate maps can help various organizations provide better services to the the South Sudanese . <p> Happy independence day to the South Sudanese ! Together , let 's continue mapping , and stay connected via our Sudan-specific email discussions . The next Community Mapping event will be in Juba , so stay tuned for more details .
