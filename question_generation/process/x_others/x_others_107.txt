Google.org will be a partner in this ambitious endeavor by providing funding for companies and projects with promising , scalable and potentially breakthrough energy technologies . Two of the early-stage companies we 've begun to work with to drive down the costs of renewable energy are eSolar Inc. and Makani Power . We 're looking for more strategic investments , so please write to us at renewables@google.com if you 're working on this problem too . <p> You may recall that last summer we announced an RFP ( request for investment proposals ) as part of our RechargeIT aiming to accelerate the adoption of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and vehicle-to-grid technology.After reviewing more than 350 applications , last week we selected just under 40 companies in categories including batteries , components and vehicle-to-grid solution to advance to the next round of review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these interesting companies during the first quarter of 2008 . <h> Wednesday 11/14/2007 07:44:00 PM <p> Posted by Michael Terrell , Team Member , Google.org <p> Today Senator Barack Obama visited Google as part of our Candidates@Google series .
