More than 70 members of the Sudanese diaspora , along with regional experts from the World Bank , Sudan Institute , Voices for Sudan , The Enough Project and other organizations gathered together to map what is expected to become the worlds newest country later this year : the Republic of South Sudan . UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has asked the international community " to assist all Sudanese towards greater stability and development " during and beyond this period of transition . <p> South Sudan is a large but under-mapped region , and there are very few high-quality maps that display essential features like roads , hospitals and schools . Up-to-date maps are particularly important to humanitarian aid groups , as they help responders target their efforts and mobilize their resources of equipment , personnel and supplies . More generally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructure and economy of the country and region . <p> The Map Maker communitya wide-ranging group of volunteers that help build more comprehensive maps of the world using our online mapping tool , Google Map Makerhas been contributing to the mapping effort for Sudan since the referendum on January 9 . To aid their work , we 've published updated satellite imagery of the region , covering 125,000 square kilometers and 40 percent of the U.N.s priority areas , to Google Earth and Maps . <p> The goal of last weeks event was to engage and train members of the Sudanese diaspora in the United States , and others who have lived and worked in the region , to use Google Map Maker so they could contribute their local knowledge of the region to the ongoing mapping effort , particularly in the area of social infrastructure . Our hope is that this event and others like it will help build a self-sufficient mapping community that will contribute their local expertise and remain engaged in Sudan over time . <p> We were inspired by the groups enthusiasm . One attendee told us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that before today did not exist on any maps that I know of ... a place unknown to the world . Now I can show to my kids , my friends , my community , where I used to live and better tell the story of my people . " <p> The group worked together to make several hundred edits to the map of Sudan in four hours . As those edits are approved , theyll appear live in Google Maps , available for all the world to see . But this wasnt just a one-day undertakingattendees will now return to their home communities armed with new tools and ready to teach their friends and family how to join the effort . We look forward to seeing the Southern Sudanese mapping community grow and flourish .
