We are minimizing our energy consumption with some of the most energy efficient data centers in the world , lowering our energy costs . And we are purchasing carbon offsets for the emissions we cant eliminate . We also seek to power our facilities with renewable energy , like one of the largest corporate solar installations at our headquarters in Mountain View , CA . And were making investments in renewable energy , such as our $38.8 million investment in two North Dakota wind farms , and our recent agreement to purchase 114MW of wind energy over a 20 year period , spurring real growth in the sector by giving the developer financial certainty to develop new projects . <p> As a technology company , we 've seen how the power of innovation can change the way we live our lives . Eric Schmidt said it best : " In Silicon Valley , it was the limitations of one technology or system that served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our industries here . AB32 provides a similar opportunity for new job creation in many sectors as business responds to the need for energy-efficient buildings , transportation and a growing portfolio of renewable energy resources .
