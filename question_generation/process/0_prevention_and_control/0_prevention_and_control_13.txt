(B) frequent hand washing, hand disinfection when necessary
It is essential to wash your hands regularly and in the right way as it can effectively cut off the transmission of the virus.
You should wash your hands promptly after coughing and sneezing, before and after touching outsiders or caring for patients, before and after preparing food, before eating, after going to the bathroom, after touching animals, after handling garbage, after outdoor sports, homework, shopping, and after touching money. If the dirt on your hands is not visible, use a no-rinse hand sanitizer that contains alcohol. Reduce contact with common objects and parts of public places; try to avoid touching your mouth, nose and eyes with your hands when you are not sure if your hands are thoroughly clean.
Hand washing must be done with running water, not basin water, and rubbing time should be at least 20 seconds. You can't just wash your hands with water, you have to use soap or hand sanitizer to effectively remove pathogenic bacteria. If soap is used, the soap should be kept clean and dry. It is best to use hand sanitizer in disposable packages, such as using replacement packs, and to clean and disinfect the container before each dispense; when the soap is cloudy or discolored, it should be replaced. If you use alcohol-based hand sanitizer, please pay attention to the expiration date of "use after opening" in the product description, generally not more than 30 days after opening the bottle; do not "rub" dry on your clothes after washing your hands, prepare dry hand towels or dryers in advance.
