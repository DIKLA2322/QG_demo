That 's the potential for Geothermal Energy in the United States , according to a recently completed 3-year project supported by Google.org to update the Geothermal Map of North America . <p> The project estimates that Technical Potential for the continental US exceeds 2,980,295 megawatts using Enhanced Geothermal Systems ( EGS ) and other advanced geothermal technologies such as Low Temperature Hydrothermal . <p> The SMU team has been developing entirely new pictures of the earth 's geothermal resources . They started by aggregating thousands of new Bottom Hole Temperature ( BHT ) readings from oil , gas , and water wells in previously under-sampled regions of the U.S. For example , The 2004 Geothermal Map of North America used only 5 heat flow points informing geothermal estimates for West Virginia , compared to the additional 1,455 BHT points in the updated version . In addition , the team has improved estimates of heat flow through the earth 's crust with better regional lithologic data .
