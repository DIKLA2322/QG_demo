I thought I might run a foundation . After our meeting , I realized that this was an entrepreneurial company that could really change with world with technology.Nearly ten years later , I am retiring from Google to advise startups and social innovators . I will also informally counsel on Google.org efforts . While sad to leave , it has been a terrific ride . Building our Business Operations and People Operations groups , I had the opportunity to develop business strategy , organizational process , and the most important ingredientthe peopleto help fuel a rapidly growing Google . In my decade as a Googler , the Internet has transformed the way we respond to critical human challenges . From ourearly days , Google has pledged to use technology to tackle big problems , and we continue to deliver on that promise todaywhether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the U.S. , Mexico , and Egypt , or investing nearly $1 billion in renewable energy projects that can become major power sources for the future.It has been incredibly rewarding to end my time at Google leading social impact efforts such as Google.org , Google Green , Crisis Response , Google Giving , and Elections . These teams are improving the world with great leaders at the helm . VP Matthew Stepka will step into my role of day-to-day leadership , while CFO Patrick Pichette will take on a more engaged role from our executive team . A lot has changed in ten years . But one thing has stayed the same . Google and others are finding new ways to tackle our biggest problems with technology . I 'm proud to be a part of that work .
