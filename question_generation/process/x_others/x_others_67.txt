The population has swelled to 100,000 from approximately 70,000 largely because of refugees fleeing the post-election violence in other parts of Kenya . Local authorities expect to see that population double over the next ten years . Providing public services , especially water and sanitation , to this growing population is an enormous challenge . <p> In 2000 , the international community made a commitment to the UN Millennium Development Goals to help communities access basic public services , like health , education , water and sanitation . One the key milestones of Goal 7 is to " halve the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015 . " As of 2004 , the MDG Monitor shows the nations bordering Lake Victoria- Uganda , Tanzania and Kenya only 60% of their populations have access to improved drinking water sources . <p> While great progress is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60% of their population has adequate service , despite what the official statistics say . New water pipes have been donated to the local water provider . This has doubled the capacity , but it only reaches half of Kisii 's estimated population ( 50,000 ) . Water kiosks stand proudly along the main road . And yet , the taps run dry . The connections to the main line are not even functional . Young women still trudge the kilometers to the river , at risk to their own security , to collect water . Bright blue toilet stalls line the periphery of a girls school . While the school has seen an increase in attendance since the installation of these toilets , they continue to be plagued by their inability to deal with the sanitation requirements of their students . As we depart , the headmistress of the school pleads with us to help with the sanitation problem . <p> Some more recent data gathered from towns surrounding Lake Victoria in Uganda , Tanzania and Kenya , tell us a very different story than information from the MDG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us on the ground : while basic infrastructure ( water pipes , points , toilets ) may exist , those facilities are rarely functional , affordable or accessible , indicating to us that access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation services is substantially lower than many think . Presented with this information at a recent UN-Habitat meeting in Nairobi , international donors and development agencies were astonished . They asked , " how come we did n't know about this earlier ? " <p> And yet , unsurprisingly , the people of Kisii have long known that they do n't have appropriate water and sanitation services . They may not have even heard of the MDG 's . They are likely unaware of the conversations that transpire amongst donors and development agencies and help shape where resources are allocated . They are having their own conversations about what they need . But who can they tell ? Who hears their voices ? <p> Our challenge going forward is to help amplify these voices and contribute to efforts to inform these local discussions .

Following on the heels of these successful MapUps , P@SHA ( Pakistan Software Houses Association for IT &amp; ITES ) , in collaboration with Google , launched a fund to drive social innovation in Pakistan . <p> The purpose of the P@SHA Social Innovation fund is to encourage big ideas by providing the Pakistani people with financial support and guidance for social innovation projects . Google has provided a seed grant of US$250,000 , which will be allocated to 25 all-star proposals that incorporate technology as a means of addressing a specific social need , such as flood relief or disease prevention . The idea is not simply to fund the creation of software , but to fund ideas that use Information and Communication Technologies as a platform for delivery and as a means for empowerment . <p> In addition to offering funding , P@SHA has established an oversight committee , advisory board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide the shortlisted proposals from inception to reality . The hope is to create a safe harbor for eager entrepreneurs to jump-start ideas without the fear of failure . P@SHA President Jehan Ara anticipates that many of these ideas will emerge from Pakistani youth . According to Jehan , one of Pakistans main strengths is that 60% of the population is below the age of 24 , something the country can leverage . Jehan believes a large number of these individuals are passionate about making a difference in the communities in which they live--and , to some extent , are already doing so . <p> Google Map Maker has already witnessed several such innovations in Pakistan , such as Sindh Flood Maps , FloodMAPS of Dr. Sohaib Khan , and http : //www.local.com.pk/ , which implement the Google Maps API to assist in disaster relief management . Proposals are being accepted through August , and are not limited by age , gender , caste or creed . P@SHA requires only that applicants be Pakistanis who are based in Pakistan and ready to share their innovations with the world . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that may be in store following P@SHAs announcement of winners in the early fall , and encourage all our avid Pakistani mappers and brilliant innovators to submit their big idea !

The floods have put one-fifth of the land underwater , impacting more than 20 million people , damaging or destroying 1.9 million homes , putting 3.5 million children at risk of waterborne diseases , and wiping out livestock and crops . <p> Amazing work is already being done by these organizations . SIUT , for example , has already established seven medical relief camps and three field hospitals in different parts of the country . Their doctors and paramedics have treated more than 100,000 people , many of whom are suffering from gastroenteritis , malaria and skin diseases . <p> In remarks during the opening plenary today , Eric Schmidt noted the importance of bringing 21st century technology solutions to disaster relief work .

We developed Resource Finder , an experimental tool that aggregates information on health facilities to help first responders , and shared our MapMaker data with the U.N . Weve published sites linked from our homepage to provide updated maps and imagery , videos , news and ways to donate in the wake of recent natural disasters in Haiti , Chile , China , Pakistan and the Gulf oil spill . <p> Were excited to be at CGI this week to learn about innovative ways to use technology to assist with health , development and disaster response . We encourage non-profits to visit our newly updated Google for NonProfits site to learn how Googles free tools can help expand the impact of each organization .
