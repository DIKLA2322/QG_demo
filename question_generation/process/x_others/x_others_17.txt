The insights from these surveys show that while more than 96% of children are enrolled in school in rural India , about half of all fifth graders still can not read a simple text or do basic arithmetic . By assessing learning levels , ASER helps to make sure that students are not only in school , but that attention is also paid to children 's learning . <p> In 2016 , Google.org donated $3 million toward devices and an additional $3.1 million to support Pratham 's Hybrid Learning Program " an initiative that empowers students to use self driven , tablet-based curricula to learn outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grade organize themselves into groups of five . Two groups share a tablet and children in each group decide together what content they 'd like to learn . Along with learning science , English and math , students also learn how to work collaboratively with their peers and foster their curiosity . <p> The data collected from the program will help Pratham and the broader sector better understand how a student focused model can accompany more traditional teacher focused models , with the hope of scaling these methodologies across India 's rural school ecosystem . The data will also help Pratham develop content that is engaging , relevant , and enriching . Googler volunteers will be contributing to these data analysis efforts .
