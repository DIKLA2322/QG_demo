He delivered a powerful talk that highlighted the risk of a devastating future pandemic , and described one of his big ideas for combating the threat . His mantra of ' Early Detection , Early Response ' inspired other groups such as InSTEDD , who recently launched a suite of open-source applications to allow collaboration between first responders during disease outbreaks and disasters , and the team behind Google Flu Trends . <p> Now , this important theme has been revisited at TED by Dr. Nathan Wolfe , founder of the Global Viral Forecasting Initiative ( GVFI ) , a new non-profit funded by Google.org and the Skoll Foundation . Dr Wolfe 's rousing message is that when it comes to pandemics , early detection in humans is n't early enough . We know that 75% of new human diseases begin in animals so to discover a pandemic before it devastates the human population , we need to catch new viruses when they take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This mission has taken the GVFI team into some remote and difficult locations , from the jungles of Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of Congo ( profiled on CNN 's Planet in Peril ) , to the wet markets of China and Malaysia .

Pass this on , and help spread ideas , not diseases ! <h> Monday 3/16/2009 05:51:00 PM <p> An interesting article making a case for the use of online information for earlier detection of disease outbreaks came out last week in the Canadian Medical Association Journal . The article , co-authored by HealthMap co-founder and Google.org grantee John Brownstein , looks at an outbreak of listeriosis in Canada and compares online search trends , news reports , and diagnosed case counts during the outbreak period . <p> Listeriosis is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Canada killed about 20 people last summer . By using Google Insights for Search data combined with HealthMap 's news surveillance data , the authors discovered that a specific search query provided even earlier indication of the outbreak than news reports . <p> So , what was that key search term that gave the earliest indication of the outbreak ? Listeriosis . That 's right , when the researchers looked at trends for people searching online for the technical term " Listeriosis , " they discovered that the peak of the search trend for that term was the same as the actual peak of medically diagnosed Listeriosis cases . The increase in online searches for " Listeriosis " began in mid-July , one month before the federal announcement that an outbreak was underway in Canada . This means that people diagnosed with Listeriosis , or others close to them , were likely to be the ones searching for that term online at the time of diagnosis , causing a spike . <p> In contrast , search trends for " Listeria , " the term used in the public announcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcement and other news reports in mid-August . Thus , people searching for " Listeria " were probably doing so in response to the press about the outbreak , not because they 'd been diagnosed . <p> Early detection is critical to helping health officials respond more quickly . While documenting the potential for using online info for earlier outbreak detection , the authors also recognize the challenges . This seems to be the tip of the iceberg for research in this area , and it has others talking too - check out the Wall Street Journal blog which calls this " a wonkier example of Google Flu Trends .

@@13268982 @1868982/ <h> Tuesday 9/30/2008 05:37:00 PM <p> On August 29 , 2005 , millions of Americans watched in horror as the wind , rain and flood waters wiped away the homes , businesses and livelihood of citizens along the Gulf Coast of the US . In the days that followed , a record number of volunteers flooded disaster response agencies , government agencies , churches and local outreach organizations with calls to find out how they could help . I was one of those volunteers and what I experienced changed my life forever . <p> Three years later , much of the region remains abandoned . Repair of city infrastructure and tourism ( the primary economic source for this part of the nation ) are slow and stagnant in much of the region . We will be successful in turning around these trends only if we come together and rededicate ourselves to this effort . As part of the Black Googlers Network ( BGN ) , 32 colleagues and I traveled to the region for what was initially slated as a Katrina Rebuilding Outreach Trip . As New Orleans slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by side with the proud and resilient residents of this amazing city to help them repair the lives they 've worked so hard to rebuild , sending a clear message that they are not forgotten . <p> As our group planned to deploy so quickly after Hurricane Gustav , most agencies were still shut down because their employees were evacuated to other parts of the country . Notable exceptions to this shut down were two organizations to which I have personal ties - St. Bernard Project and The Idea Village . <p> St. Bernard Project is a nonprofit , community-based organization that began rebuilding homes in August 2006 ( boasting 177 projects to date ) that were damaged by flood waters from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in St. Bernard Parish , Louisiana . St. Bernard Parish is a working class community and was one of the hardest hit parishes of the city because of its location just 5 miles from the now infamous Industrial Levee . <p> The Idea Village is an organization working to accelerate the growth of the entrepreneurial community in the embattled New Orleans region . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launch plan for their 504ward $200,000 business plan competition by employing our business savvy , creative thought processes and Google product knowledge . Launched on September 25th , this competition hopes to keep the thousands of young people who have flocked to New Orleans since Katrina engaged by soliciting ideas on how to develop a strong foundation of entrepreneurial ventures . The Idea Village 's motto is " Trust Your Crazy Ideas , " but I do n't see anything crazy about wanting to rebuild one of America 's greatest cities . <p> The highlight of the trip was that at each build site , the families whose homes we were returning to their former grace stopped by to say hello , offer their gratitude and recount the stories of survival . Andrea was the owner of the home I was rebuilding . She was the mother of two small children and was anxious to return a sense of normalcy to all of their lives . Andrea told us of the time her adventurous son wandered into the deep grass behind her home only to come face to face with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiously inspected the snake , only to be whisked up by his attentive mother just as the serpent was preparing to strike . This snake 's venom could kill a full grown man in 20 minutes . The closest emergency room , as a result the devastation , is over 45 minutes away . Even with all of the progress made to get people back into their homes , communities are fractured and without basic services and business opportunities . <p> On the final day of our trip , we went to the Upper and Lower Ninth Ward , the areas most devastated by the hurricanes . The neighborhoods were absent of life ; there is little or nothing for residents to come back to . But signs of hope included children riding bikes , families and neighbors barbecuing on the front lawns of their homes ( many still tattooed with the post storm FEMA markings ) and a few bold projects such as the The Musicians ' Village and Brad Pitt 's Make it Right project . These things remind me not to view New Orleans with sadness or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer a hand in their greatest time of need . In our case , 64 hands . <h> Friday 9/19/2008 11:36:00 AM <p> Disagreements may make headlines in the energy policy debate , but you know we 're getting somewhere when an oil company executive , a foreign policy expert , and Dan Reicher , Google.org 's Director of Climate Change and Energy Initiatives , agree on the most effective way of lowering today 's high energy costs : improving energy efficiency . <p> This past Friday , Dan Reicher participated with these and other experts in an energy summit convened by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee ahead of possible votes on legislative proposals pending in Congress . Energy has taken center stage in D.C. during this short session before the October recess , and more than two dozen senators participated in the summit 's morning session alone . <p> Dan and other member of the panel stressed the importance of improving energy efficiency as the low-hanging fruit in the energy policy debate . He pointed to the role of IT in making homes , businesses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consider setting more aggressive national efficiency standards like those in place today in California . <p> Dan also emphasized the need to extend renewable energy tax credits . During this discussion , senators expressed particular interest in the promise of enhanced geothermal systems ( EGS ) technology which Google has championed in recent months . Many participants also emphasized the need to make tax incentives more consistent and reliable to avoid sending " stop-and-go " signals to businesses and investors . <h> 9/19/2008 11:36:00 AM <p> For years , first scientists , then the media and politicians debated whether the observed global warming trend is due to natural variability or human-induced changes in the climate system . Fortunately , this debate has now been mostly put to rest with the release of the fourth assessment of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) last year , which stated : " Warming of the climate system is unequivocal. ( and ) most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a new life . This time the debate is not focused on attributing a cause to global warming but rather what to do about adapting to it impacts . Is improving management to current climate variability an adaptation strategy ? Or is climate adaptation more about developing strategies to manage the severe climate change impacts projected for 20-50 years in the future ? <p> Questions such as these arose in a recent workshop that Google.org sponsored in Kenya on climate and health . " Are we talking about climate variability or climate change ? " participants would ask during working groups focused on identifying strategies for reducing vulnerability to the emergence and spread of climate-sensitive diseases . <p> The crux of the variability vs. change discussion began when Phil Thornton from ILRI presented an overview of the state of the science on climate projections which highlighted the huge uncertainty in projections from the Global Climate Models ( GCMs ) out toward the middle and end of century . Then Caroline Kisia , executive director of Action Africa Help International ( AAHI ) and a medical doctor who works with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate science stuff is interestingbut it is not clear what communities are supposed to do with this information there is too much uncertainty to define any real actions here . <p> A few case studies were then presented showing how weather and seasonal climate projections have the potential for improving management for climate-sensitive diseases such as rift valley fever , malaria , meningitis and dengue . These seemed to be helpful , but how are they related to climate adaptation ? <p> These are all good points and good questions . It seems that Caroline was asking the climate scientists and health experts in the room to put aside their fancy models and labels and just focus on the community needs . <p> Communities today across the globe , and especially in Africa , have many needs related to managing the risks of climate and weather including floods , droughts , and climate-sensitive diseases . The workshop discussions highlighted the opportunities and challenges of connecting the climate and health sectors to build tools for managing these risks . <p> Ultimately , for the poorest regions of the world facing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part simply about a heightened need for communities and nations to do what they need to do anyway in pursuit of sustainable development such as improve health services , develop drought-resistant crop options and diversify income sources . <p> Does this all then just come down to semantics ? At the community level it may be best not to worry about labels such as variability , change or adaptation . However , the implications of these semantics may be far reaching as policymakers to develop much needed climate adaptation assistance programs and face important questions such as who should pay for climate adaptation in the poorest nations where communities are most vulnerable to but least responsible for the changes underway ? And what should be paid for , that is , what constitutes climate adaptation ? <p> These are tough questions . I am optimistic that if we do n't get stuck on the semantics but keep our eyes on our goals we will find solutions to enable the most vulnerable populations to take the concrete actions needed to improve their health and livelihoods . <p> Rosemary Sang led a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessons learned from the major RVF outbreak in 2006-07 where 155 people died . <h> 9/19/2008 11:36:00 AM <p> A guest post from our friends and partners at the Acumen Fund : <p> If you care about market-based approaches to poverty alleviation , then the Acumen Fund Fellowship might be a dream job . Seriously - you can spend a full year living and working at the nexus of development and enterprise ! Of course , there 's an application and an interview process , and Acumen Fund is looking for a specific kind of person - someone with " the moral imagination , the practical skills and the leadership potential to effect real change , " as Acumen Fund 's Deepti Doshi put it on the Acumen Fund blog . <p> If you are interested in the base of the pyramid sector and believe you have the skills and experience to contribute to this mission over the next year , please apply . If you 're happy doing what you 're doing , fantastic . But I 'm sure you know a few people for whom the fellowship is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Lab aims to address the " missing middle " of finance , a term that describes the shortage of capital available to SMEs in developing country economies . In developed countries , SMEs represent half of GDP and two-thirds of jobs , but they 're largely absent in developing countries . Access to finance is a critical constraint , despite evidence that there are highly profitable untapped growth opportunities . It requires taking some risk . We saw this firsthand when we met Joseph Tackie in Ghana , an entrepreneur whose sales quintupled after getting a relatively small amount of seed capital . <p> The mission of EFL is to develop a screening test that could be a criterion for loans to SMEs . Because these businesses often lack formal accounting ledgers or established credit histories , it 's very difficult for investors and lenders to gauge risk or finance-worthiness of businesses . When evaluating developing country SMEs , financial institutions have little information to be able to make investment decisions or measure the trustworthiness of clients . Does she have a good track record at repayments and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Does she understand the market and how to run a business ? Evidence suggests information such as credit scores helped banks penetrate the SME market here in the US . <p> We hope the EFL test will address the information asymmetry and help entrepreneurs get their foot in the door at banks and investment firms . The test , a psychometric screening tool , will assess " soft traits " of psychological , social , and cognitive characteristics to measure a person 's entrepreneurial potential . Financiers can then use the information to make lending decisions . The test could be an initial step toward the goal of expanding profitable lending to the missing middle . <p> EFL is already working with SME financiers in Africa , India and Latin America to refine their tool through field testing and pilots . The team is currently looking for institutions to partner with on these pilot tests , and offers financial institutions early access to the screening technology ( interested parties should contact efl@harvard.edu ) .

Eric Schmidt and GE CEO Jeff Immelt discuss solutions to our energy challenge in this video : <p> As a South African medical doctor with training and experience firmly fixed on human health , I am continuously struck by the enormous challenge of communicating usefully across academic disciplinary boundaries in a way that allows the science to inform relevant , practical action . While the information on climate variability and change was fascinating , I still struggled to understand how and why this could have direct implications for the day-to-day work of someone like me . <p> Fortunately , the convening included several case studies designed to illustrate the real benefits of collaboration . First , we looked closely at the Kenyan outbreak of Rift Valley Fever ( RVF ) in 2006/7 . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both humans and livestock , and carries an enormous economic cost . In late October and mid-November of 2006 , two early warnings were issued based on evidence of above-normal rainfall that could be detected using remote sensing imagery . Unfortunately it was not until weeks later when the first human cases were observed that the outbreak was recognized , despite the fact that several livestock deaths had already occurred . Although the climate-based warnings and animal deaths were both early indicators of potential human disease , these opportunities for intervention were missed due to communication gaps between the different scientific communities . It 's often said that diseases do n't respect national boundaries , but RVF is the perfect example of a disease that does n't respect academic boundaries either . As the Kenyan example shows , successful control of disease in humans requires collaboration with those working on environmental , animal health and insect science issues ( at a minimum ! ) .
