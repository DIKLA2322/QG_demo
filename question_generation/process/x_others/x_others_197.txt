Public health officials around the world tried to stop the virus at the borders but were largely helpless . Shortly after , on the other side of the world from Mexico , I saw the health check posts in Cambodia at the airport and at a borderpost with Vietnam , right when the country found its first H1N1 cases which were flown in by US exchange students . The weapons used by the health officials to combat the spread of the virus were primarily paper survey forms and thermometers ; the virus won , very quickly . Genomics is rapidly changing both the way diseases are diagnosed and the way medications and vaccines are developed - but will it give us the tools to prevent the next pandemic ? <p> What if countries where emerging infections originate , from Cameroon to Cambodia , could rapidly sequence suspect samples and discover new pathogens when only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such sequence data were immediately shared in a single global open access database ? <p> What if you could search for a string of sequence data and all associated data , annotations or publications as easily and effectively as a Google search ? <p> What if markers discovered for a new disease would quickly be incorporated into affordable hand held multi-pathogen diagnostic tests widely available at the point of care ? <p> What if the results of those tests were uploaded to a database where surveillance tools like Google Flu Trends could discover outbreaks ? <p> Today the Public Library of Science , a mission driven , non-profit and open access publisher , presents " The Genomics of Infectious Disease " a collection of essays , perspectives and reviews that explores how genomicswith all its associated tools and techniquescan provide insights into our understanding of emerging infectious disease . This collection was produced with financial support from Google.org with the editorial independence and rigor of PLoS and the expert opinion of leading researchers . <p> In one piece Rajesh Gupta , Mark Michalski ( of Stanford , but at Google.org @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for how systematic application of genomics , proteomics , and bioinformatics to infectious diseases could predict and prevent the next pandemic . To realize this vision , however , we feel that a focused , coordinated and scaled-up effort would be required . We urge the community to unite under an " Infectious Disease Genomics Project , " analogous to the Human Genome Project , to accelerate today 's impressive progress as reviewed by this cross-journal open access collection .
