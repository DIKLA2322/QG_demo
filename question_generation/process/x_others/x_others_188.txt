The forum , now in its fourth year , is organized by Koji Omi , former Minster of Finance and Science and Technology of Japan . The dual theme of the forum was " returning to harmony with nature " and " innovation " . It examined the linked challenges of climate , energy , and water , together with impacts and contributions of the digital , biotechnology , and nanotechnology revolutions . <p> The new Japanese Prime Minister , Yasuo Fukuda , kicked off the meeting by stressing the need to make the transition to a sustainable society through science and technology . There was remarkable consensus in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest challenges we face . Science and technology helped humanity alter the face of the planet at an unprecedented rate , and human activities are now threatening the geo-bio-chemical systems on which all life on earth is based . Science and technology must now be deployed to help regain balance . <p> The most amazing side of the meeting is how " mainstream " this message has suddenly become . As a sustainable development professional , I have gone to environmentalist meetings with pretty much the same message for two decades . Then , however , I was preaching to the converted . Suddenly , mainstream leaders from government , business , and academia are now singing the same song . Al Gores film awakened an environmental consciousness in the general population , and it seems we have finally passed a tipping point ! To me that is great news . <p> There was debate on how to best balance the allocation of resources for climate change mitigation ( i.e. greenhouse gas emission reduction ) and for climate change adaptation ( i.e. increasing societys resilience in dealing with a changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who have contributed the least to global warming but will bear the brunt of its impact - particularly in Africa . There , farmers throughout the continent will face catastrophic crop losses due to increased droughts , people in the highlands of countries such as Ethiopia will be introduced to malaria and East African coastal countries will face sea level rise that can cost up to 10% of GDP . <p> I was there to give my perspective on water-related challenges for science and technology , and although only a handful of the participants shared my area of expertise , I was pleasantly surprised to see this meeting put in its final statement that , " Water , whether it is for drinking or for agriculture , is now one of the most pressing global issues we must deal with . " <p> Japan will chair and host next years G8 summit , and Koji Omi fully intends to have the conclusions of this year 's Science and Technology in Society Forum influence next year 's debate . In a world where small steps count , this meeting was a small step in the right direction .
