@@13269049 @1869049/ <h> Thursday 8/12/2010 10:09:00 AM <p> I 've learned a lot as an intern with Google.orgs health efforts the last few months . Just this week I learned about a new collaboration between Google.org grantee HealthMap - the same group mentioned in our previous post Swine flu near you ? - and the Dengue Branch of the US Centers for Disease Prevention and Control ( CDC ) . Theyve created DengueMap to show recent reports of dengue around the world and regions where people are at risk to catch it . The reports on DengueMap are updated multiple times a day , keeping you up-to-date on where dengue is . <p> One week ago , I barely knew a thing about dengue . It turns out 2.5 billion people around the world are at risk of contracting dengue , and 50 to 100 million people get sick from it every year . Dengue is present in more than 100 countries , and dengue is on the rise in many parts of the world . This even includes the US . According to the CDC , there have been 28 cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this does n't  sound like a lot of cases , its somewhat alarming given that there were only a handful of cases ever recorded before 2009 . <p> Dengue thrives in both cities and rural areas of the tropics and subtropics and is caused by a virus that is transmitted by mosquitoes . The symptoms are similar to a severe flu , and can be quite painful . There is no cure and no vaccine . Fortunately , dengue rarely causes death , though severe complications , like dengue hemorrhagic fever , can be lethal . <p> The bottom line ? Be smart about protecting yourself from dengue . Know the areas where dengue is present ( DengueMap is helpful for this ) and wear bug spray .
