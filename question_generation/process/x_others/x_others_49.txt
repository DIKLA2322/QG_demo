Using untapped spectrum can help improve broadband access in many parts of the worldas its doing in our trial in South Africaand spark new innovation in wireless technology . <p> In March , we shared an update on our efforts to become a certified database administrator for a band of spectrum called the TV white spaces . Today , our database received final certification from the FCC.This is an exciting step forward . With FCC certification , we can do more to help make spectrum available . We are ready to work with leaders in the wireless industrythose developing certified devices that can talk to a databaseto help them gain access to TV White spaces spectrum to help bring new technologies and services to market . Our database has already helped to show that there is available spectrum out there--if you know where to look . For example , we used the database to help visualize available spectrum in Cape Town , South Africa and Dakar , Senegal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , multiple users can share spectrum , accessing what they they need when they need it , and allowing others to use it when they do n't  . With more unused spectrum being put to good use , we hope to see more wireless innovation and wireless broadband access for users.Posted by Alan Norman , Principal , Access <p> This embeddable map shows evacuation zones , emergency shelter locations , public alerts , traffic conditions , and more .

Usingpublic datarecently released by the government on topics like crime , health and the environment , developers built new applications that help address social challenges.At the Googleplex in Mountain View , we hosted nearly 100 developers , statisticians , data scientists , and designers , who stayed long into the night hacking together prototypes that show how data on health and the environment can be used to enrich lives . Fusion TablesandGoogle App Enginewere used to prototype , and groups relied onBigQueryas a workhorse to crunch the biggest datasets . Participants used Google+ Hangouts to connect with hackathons in other states and collaborated with Google Apps and platforms.Here are a few highlights from the hackathon that stood out as useful , visually stunning , and informative ways to use public data : <p> Eat Healthy for Less , the winner of our Mountain View hackathon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pricing Index to suggest healthy recipes that can be made on a budget . <p> Data+ , a reimagining of how we access data , can make exploring public datasets more intuitive and easily understandable for everyone . <p> Detoxic.org is a web experience and Android app that shows you toxic sites and landfills nearby that you might not know about so that you can take civic action against toxic waste . <p> Many of the ideas have great potential , and we are encouraging participants to continue their work . We hope that the National Day of Civic Hacking will be a catalyst for innovation in this space , and encourage you to keep track of our tools for civic developers at g.co/civicdevelopers . <h> Monday 6/03/2013 06:21:00 PM <p> To help bring more of Africa online , we often work with others : offering programs to get universities connected , supporting nonprofit innovators to increase engineering know-how , and partnering to test the use of TV White Spaces for broadband access in underserved areas .

TV White Spaces are important because they offer available and underutilized spectrum ( especially in less developed areas ) , allow signals to travel over long distances , and can enable a lower-cost alternative for broadband . <p> TV White Spaces are available . Using our spectrum database , we shared a visual of available white space in Senegal . There is more than 90 MHz available in Dakar alone , and more across the country--spectrum that could be used for broadband . Compared to the San Francisco Bay area , the number of available channels is remarkable . <p> Regulation can pave a path in African markets . ICASA , the South African regulator , plans to use trial outcomes to evaluate possible rules for use of the TV White Spaces . Other regulators showing interest in TV White Spaces for broadband included Senegal , as well as Malawi , where less than 9% of the population receives broadcast TV and many channels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White Spaces . Radio manufacturers shared how TV White Spaces radios can talk to a database , which tells the radio which channels are available in a given geography . Adaptrum and Carlson presented the results of deployments of these radios , in Kenya and South Africa respectively . <p> From trials to databases to radios , these efforts show that players are stepping up to use TV White Spaces to help enable Internet access in West Africa and beyond . That 's good news for a future where more people have access to the Web .

That 's why we 've launched aGoogle Crisis Mapto show fire information across five Australian states and territories.The Google Crisis Mapshows information about current fires including their location and size the level of alert , whether the fire is under control and which local emergency response agency is responding to the crisis . Working with fire authorities across Australia , the Crisis Map is continually updated and can be accessed from any device connected to the web at **30;600;TOOLONG . <p> Example of a fire warning and fire incidents on the Google Crisis Map <p> In addition to the Crisis Map , Google Public Alerts is now also available for NSW . Google Public Alerts show you relevant fire information when looking up related terms on Google Maps or Google Search .

@@13269049 @1869049/ <h> Thursday 8/12/2010 10:09:00 AM <p> I 've learned a lot as an intern with Google.orgs health efforts the last few months . Just this week I learned about a new collaboration between Google.org grantee HealthMap - the same group mentioned in our previous post Swine flu near you ? - and the Dengue Branch of the US Centers for Disease Prevention and Control ( CDC ) . Theyve created DengueMap to show recent reports of dengue around the world and regions where people are at risk to catch it . The reports on DengueMap are updated multiple times a day , keeping you up-to-date on where dengue is . <p> One week ago , I barely knew a thing about dengue . It turns out 2.5 billion people around the world are at risk of contracting dengue , and 50 to 100 million people get sick from it every year . Dengue is present in more than 100 countries , and dengue is on the rise in many parts of the world . This even includes the US . According to the CDC , there have been 28 cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this does n't  sound like a lot of cases , its somewhat alarming given that there were only a handful of cases ever recorded before 2009 . <p> Dengue thrives in both cities and rural areas of the tropics and subtropics and is caused by a virus that is transmitted by mosquitoes . The symptoms are similar to a severe flu , and can be quite painful . There is no cure and no vaccine . Fortunately , dengue rarely causes death , though severe complications , like dengue hemorrhagic fever , can be lethal . <p> The bottom line ? Be smart about protecting yourself from dengue . Know the areas where dengue is present ( DengueMap is helpful for this ) and wear bug spray .
