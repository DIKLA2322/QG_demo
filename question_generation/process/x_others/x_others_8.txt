@@13268823 @1868823/ <h> About the Analysis <p> We conducted this analysis to evaluate , at a basic economic level , the benefits of breakthrough rates of innovation in clean technology using McKinsey and Company 's US Low Carbon Economics Tool . <p> The model estimates potential changes in energy and the economy from different technology and policy inputs . It does n't predict what will happen , but rather offers perspective on potential outcomes from different inputs , such as energy prices . <h> Scenarios <h> Business as Usual <h> Clean Power Breakthrough <p> This scenario modeled major clean energy technologies including nuclear , solar PV ( Utility and Rooftop ) , solar CSP , on-shore &amp; off-shore wind , geothermal including Enhanced Geothermal Systems ( EGS ) , and new &amp; retrofit CCS . In each case , we selected an extremely aggressive breakthrough LCOE level for 2020 and 2030 . These rates were set by our own aspirational estimates of each technology 's potential , informed by technical cost models and industry experts . State and federal policies remained the same as BAU . <h> Storage Breakthrough <p> Storage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand , and prevent service interruptions . Two basic types of breakthroughs in grid-storage were modeled : short duration storage capable of discharging loads for less than 1 hour ; and larger scale storage capable of discharging for over 1 hour . We then modeled five business cases for storage : 1 ) Frequency Regulation ; 2 ) Load Following ; 3 ) Price Arbitraging ; 4 ) Capacity Deferment ; and 5 ) Grid Reliability . State and federal policies remained the same as BAU . <h> All-Tech Breakthrough <p> Power , Storage , and EV Breakthroughs . <h> Electric Vehicle Breakthrough <p> This scenario modeled the impacts of battery breakthroughs on PHEV , HEV , and EV vehicles . Vehicle adoption was driven by a consumer choice model which was triggered by total cost of ownership ( TCO ) and vehicle range , in competition with Compressed Natural Gas ( CNG ) and conventional Internal Combustion Engine vehicles ( ICE ) . Impacts were modeled for both the light duty and medium duty vehicle segments . Breakthrough energy densities were not high enough to displace long-haul heavy trucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State and federal policies remained the same as BAU . <h> $30/Ton Carbon Price <p> This scenario models a power sector-only carbon price used to fund a cut in corporate and individual income tax rates . The $30/ton price was chose for its ability to cause natural-gas generation to be dispatched ahead of coal , since the carbon intensity of coal generation can be more than double that of combined cycle gas turbines . Absent very aggressive cost reductions in clean energy , much higher natural gas prices , or regulation on natural gas , a price on carbon below $30/ton may not sufficiently incentivize cleaner sources . <h> $30/Ton Carbon Price + Breakthrough <h> Clean Policy <p> The Clean Policy scenario models a package of mandates , standards , and incentives . It includes : a national CES of 15% by 2020 and 25% by 2030 ; national EERS of 5% by 2020 and 10% by 2030 ( roughly 20% capture of total energy efficiency potential ) ; extension of PTC and ITC through 2030 capped at $10 billion annually along with loan guarantees for all clean technologies capitalized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 2016 to 2025 , 1%/year thereafter for LDVs ; and coal retirements of roughly 55GW by 2020 based on strict EPA regulations along with tightening of SOx/NOx caps , MACT/HAPs , transport rule 316b ( cooling towers ) , and CCR ( ash disposal ) . <h> Clean Policy + Breakthrough <p> This scenario uses the same policies as " Clean Policy " but integrates breakthroughs in Power , Storage , and EVs. <h> $3 Natural Gas <p> Natural Gas has undergone a revolution in just the last few years driven by the advent of shale technology . What if innovation in gas technology continues , bringing additional low-cost resources online ? To model gas innovation ( and assuming shale gas is not heavily regulated ) , gas prices were held at the arbitrarily low level of $3/MMBTU and assumed to have sufficient supply to meet all demand . <h> $3 Natural Gas + Breakthrough <h> Delay Breakthrough <p> This scenario models breakthroughs in Power , Storage , and EVs . Except instead of starting breakthrough learning curves in 2010 , they start in 2015 from the 2015 BAU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and natural gas were were pegged at 50% above those from the US Energy Information Administration 's AEO 2011 projections . <h> High Commodities + Breakthrough <p> High commodity prices plus breakthroughs in Power , Storage , and EVs . Commodity prices for oil and natural gas were were pegged at 50% above those from the US Energy Information Administration 's AEO 2011 projections .
