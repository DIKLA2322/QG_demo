@@13268970 @1868970/ <h> Tuesday 7/20/2010 08:11:00 AM <p> Down a remote alleyway in Dar es Salaam , Gregory Mchopa picks up his paint brush and studies the empty canvas . He closes his eyes and visualizes his next painting , whether that be a group of Maasai women collecting water from a well , or villagers dancing before a brilliant Tanzanian sunset . For years , Gregory has been capturing the rich heritage of the Tanzanian Maasai with painstaking dedication . His delicate strokes against the canvas radiate a warmth and brightness unrivaled by his peers - one that had once never reached far beyond that maze of streets in Dar es Salaam . <p> It was n't until the summer of 2007 that I first had the privilege of meeting Gregory Mchopa and witnessing his work . I had traveled to Tanzania as part of an outreach trip for google.org , during which we met with local businesses in Dar es Salaam and gave presentations with the goal to spark local economic growth . We spoke before local entrepreneurs , established businessmen , and government politicians ; but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maze of streets that we truly recognized the potential for sparking local enterprise . After watching Gregory paint a brilliant work of three Maasai women carrying water over their heads to the backdrop of a sweeping red sky , he sat down to explain the difficulties of being an artist in Tanzania : a limited market , a lack of connectivity , and an absence of distribution channels . <p> Gregory suffered not for lack of passion or talent , but from the lack of technologies and services that could broadcast his work to a far wider audience . After returning to the States , I worked with BRUTE LABS ( a non-profit I founded with several other Googlers ) to build a simple website , www.mchopa.com , that would bring Gregory 's work before a global audience . Using several Google tools that are free and easy to use - App Engine , Checkout , Spreadsheets , Gmail - we developed a website and interface for Gregory that serves as an open source model for other artists in the developing world seeking to showcase and sell their work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has sold 47 paintings and kept all of the profits . Perhaps more significantly , Gregory 's web presence has connected him with gallery representatives and individual collectors in the US , Canada , and the UK , many of whom have requested custom works for display . The culture of the Maasai has now spread to people around the world . <p> Down a remote alleyway in Dar es Salaam , Gregory Mchopa continues to faithfully wield his paint brush , capturing the heritage of his country and people . But through Google 's online suite of tools , he now wields the power to broadcast his work far beyond that maze of streets to a global audience of buyers , suppliers , and admirers . The only question left for us now : who 's the next Gregory Mchopa ? <p> We just completed a substantial 20-year green Power Purchase Agreement that allows us to take responsibility for our footprint and foster true growth in the renewable energy sector . On July 30 we will begin purchasing the clean energy from 114 megawatts of wind generation at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a predetermined rate for 20 years . Incorporating such a large amount of wind power into our portfolio is tricky ( read more about how the deal is structured ) , but this power is enough to supply several data centers . <p> The wind farm , which began operation in December 2009 , consists of 100 GE 1.5MW XLE turbines . <p> By contracting to purchase so much energy for so long , were giving the developer of the wind farm financial certainty to build additional clean energy projects . The inability of renewable energy developers to obtain financing has been a significant inhibitor to the expansion of renewable energy . Weve been excited about this deal because taking 114 megawatts of wind power off the market for so long means producers have the incentive and means to build more renewable energy capacity for other customers . <p> We depend upon large quantities of electricity to power Google services and want to make large actions to support renewable energy . As we continue operating with the most energy efficient data centers and working to be carbon neutral , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> 7/20/2010 12:02:00 AM <p> The world has lost a brilliant scientist , a dynamic communicator , and a caring soul . Dr. Stephen Schneider , a Stanford Professor and a global leader in climate change science died Monday morning of a heart attack . <p> Steve was an important mentor and friend to me , as I know he was to many scientists and activists around the world . For many years I turned to Steve for advice on climate science and insights into the political process . I remember one line he often repeated to me : <p> " Amy , when it comes to climate science , always stick to the facts , the truth is bad enough . " <p> Steve was brilliant at communicating the facts in plain language always driving home the message of risk . Managing climate change was like his struggle with leukemia , it required making decisions with incomplete information to improve the odds that you live a better and longer life . <p> Last year Steve collaborated with us on developing a Google Earth tour that provides a glimpse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting the final touches on this Google Earth Tour , I asked Steve if he would be at the World Climate Conference in Geneva , hoping we could meet up in person . His response in a late night email was : <p> " Nope , I wont be there . I was at first two , as described in detail in Science as a Contact Sportwe got the ball rolling . SO your generation now takes up the baton--have fun . " <p> We have the baton Steve and will not let it go . And in your honor , I promise to have fun .
