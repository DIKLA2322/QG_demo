@@13269108 @1869108/ <h> Thursday 7/10/2008 04:26:00 PM <p> HakiElimu , one of Google.orgs partners , recently released an important report about the quality of education in Tanzania to stimulate a national discussion about the challenges facing the education sector . Media coverage in Dar es Salaam indicates the report has already made an impression and is prompting the government to act . <p> For too long , success in the education sector has been defined by the number of schools and classrooms built and by the increase in student enrollment - measures that do n't necessarily register learning . But the conversation is now shifting : " quality " has become more front and center , forcing governments and development agencies to re-evaluate their policies . <p> Its hard to address the " quality " issue without knowing what children can and can not do . Part of HakiElimus report captures a " snapshot of the quality of education actually provided in schools by presenting the results of short tests administered to children in primary and secondary schools . " The sample pool is small , but the findings are interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . Here are two of the findings that I found most powerful and alarming : <p> One of the tests was a short dictation in both Kiswahili , the national language , and English ( a total of 483 primary school students and 559 secondary school students were tested ) . While students scored higher on the Kiswahili dictations , HakiElimu found it " concerning that 25% of primary pupils Kiswahili dictations were rated " poor . " Pupils who took this test had completed six years of schooling in Kiswahili and yet one in four were unable to write a coherent paragraph as dictated in the national language . In the dictations , students in both primary and secondary schools made fundamental errors in punctuation , giving researchers the impression that these things are not taught in schools . Children were often using the improper case for letters . Similarly , many did not appear to have a sense of spacing between words , or between letters in the word and between sentences . Knowledge of punctuation was also limited " ( page 29 ) <p> The next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Kiswahili while in secondary schools the language of instruction is in English . As the report indicates , this is problematic . <p> " Overall , data show that while childrens Kiswahili language competencies are generally well developed , English language competencies are poorly developed in both primary and secondary school students . Students had difficulty in reading , writing and translating the language . This is particularly troublesome in case of secondary school students . On entering secondary schools , children not only have to relearn all the terms and concepts in a new language but also to take on a more difficult set of subjects . If the majority of the students in secondary schools are unable to read and understand the language in which they are taught , as our data show , it is difficult to see how their learning can be enhanced . ( page 33 ) <p> My colleagues and I often say " you ca n't fix what you cant see . " This report helps to highlight to communities , organizations and the government that while money might be spent on education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More information and data about these outcomes help create the metrics , so action can be taken to fix these gaps . We are proud of HakiElimu 's work and their commitment to ensuring that citizens and government know more about the quality of education in Tanzania . We believe that the information and the discussions it is sparking in Tanzania are important first steps toward improving the educational system .
@@13269110 @1869110/ <h> Thursday 12/13/2007 09:15:00 AM <p> Posted by Kirsten Olsen , Project Manager , Google.org <p> Though all 15,000 participants of the UN climate conference have come to Bali to discuss the global response to climate change , there are many points of entry to the debate . Some enter through the policy door , seeking better rules to mandate emissions reductions . Others enter through the investment door , seeking profit from carbon markets and clean technologies . And an increasing number of participants come through the global development door , seeking " climate justice " for poor populations effected by global warming . As Meena Raman of Friends of the Earth International in Malaysia explained , " We all agree that climate change is happening , but now we have to ask the question of how to share the burden of adjustment . " <p> Just how large that " burden of adjustment " will be is uncertain , but the UN Human Development Report released in anticipation of UN Conference proclaims that " climate change is the defining human development challenge of the 21st Century " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stall and then reverse international efforts to reduce poverty . " The idea of climate justice comes into play when considering who will pay for climate adaptation when those countries that have done the least to cause global warming bear the greatest cost . Different groups here in Bali have even attempted to put a dollar amount to the cost of adaptation . Oxfam , for example , estimates the cost to be $50 billion per year and far more if emissions are not cut rapidly . <p> For many NGOs in Bali , climate change offers an opportunity to engage a new community of stakeholders and introduce ideas of environmental equity into the debate . Victoria Tauli-Corpuz , the Chairperson of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues , described the phenomenon as a " moment to challenge traditional development paradigms . " Local organizations such as the Indonesian Civil Society Forum for Climate Justice have sprung up in the past year to address the climate challenge while more established NGOs such as UNICEF have begun to incorporate work on climate justice and adaptation into their work . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bali focus on climate justice and adaptation , they are still a relatively small percentage of the overall NGO representation at the conference . Michael Dorsey from Dartmouth College and the Durban Group for Climate Justice points out that the International Emissions Trading Association ( IETA ) still dominates in Bali with 336 representatives making up 8% of all NGOs listed . That is equal to more than the delegation of Greenpeace ( 2% ) , the World Wildlife Fund ( 1.6% ) and Friends of the Earth ( 1.5% ) combined . <p> One silver lining that is gaining momentum here in Bali is the idea of " green jobs " created in the new energy economy . Most admit that further research on this topic is necessary to determine which sectors of society will benefit most from these jobs , but the concept resonates with many climate justice advocates in search for solutions .

Whether you 're attending in-person , or reading news headlines from home , you ca n't miss the fact that addressing climate change requires the world to solve a mind-boggling mix of science , policy and political issues . These are formidable challenges , but new technologies can help provide solutions for these complex problems . For example , one of the most promising areas of compromise has been an accord to compensate countries for preserving forests and other natural landscapes that play a crucial role in reducing emissions . Implementation of the agreement , known as Reducing Emissions From Deforestation and Forest Degradation , or REDD , will require the ability to accurately track deforestation at a regional and global level . <p> Despite the widespread availability of global satellite imagery through products like Google Earth and Google Maps , it has n't been easy for tropical nations to understand the state of their ecosystem , and to quantitatively monitor changes in forest coverage or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announce a new computational platform for global-scale analysis of satellite imagery : Earth Engine , powered by Google . <p> At an event today hosted by Avoided Deforestation Partners , global leaders from the President of Guyana to the Prime Minister of Norway expressed their support for REDD . Earlier today , the U.S , Australia , France , Japan , Norway and Britain pledged $3.5 billion over the next three years to protect rainforests . At the event , I demonstrated a prototype forest monitoring application built on top of Earth Engine that we developed together with the Carnegie Institution for Science , IMAZON and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation . Traditional forest monitoring is complex and expensive , requiring access to large amounts of satellite data , lots of hard drives to hold the data , lots of computers to process the data , and lots of time while you wait for various computations to finish . Our prototype demonstrates how Earth Engine makes all of this easier , by moving everything into the cloud . Google supplies data , storage , and computing muscle . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a second over the web , instead of the minutes or hours that traditional offline systems require for such analysis . The prototype applications running on Earth Engine are n't yet available to the public , but you can see screen shots in our earlier blog post . <p> We want to ensure this technology is widely available when it 's ready , so today I formally announced Google.org 's commitment to provide our Earth Engine free to tropical countries to support their forest monitoring programs . I believe that this is just the first of many Earth Engine applications that will help enable scientists , policymakers , and the general public to better monitor and understand the Earth 's ecosystems .
