When teachers do receive training , it 's often a one-time , disconnected event that does n't bridge the gap between pedagogical theory and day-to-day teaching practice . <p> Tangerine:Tutor , an open-source software platform built by RTI International , attacks this problem by helping teacher coaches in low-resource environments provide targeted guidance that leads to improved student learning . During classroom visits , coaches use Tangerine:Tutor to record teacher observations and conduct rapid student assessments . Combining this data with information from past coaching visits , the platform can then offer tailored feedback , relevant videos , and instructional apps to reinforce quality classroom practice . @qwx162836 <p> As a platform that can be adapted to local curricula and context , Tangerine:Tutor is uniquely positioned to help governments and NGOs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Google.org will help RTI update Tangerine:Tutor 's technical infrastructure and open-source documentation to help the product scale to other educational systems , including Nepal and Uganda , in pursuit of their five-year goal of supporting teachers who reach 4 million students .
