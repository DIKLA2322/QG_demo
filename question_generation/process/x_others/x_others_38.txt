Now you can see what 's happening firsthand on YouTube , through a live stream of the leak on PBS NewsHours YouTube channel . Today , BP will begin their " top kill " procedure , which will attempt to drill mud into the well to block the flowing oil . Thanks to the urging of Congress , you 'll be able to witness the entire process in real-time on YouTube . <p> Now that you can see what 's going on , PBS and YouTube want you to submit your best ideas , via Google Moderator , on how to stop this environmental catastrophe . PBS NewsHour will air some of the top YouTube submissions in their broadcast tomorrow evening and online : <p> Many of you have already come up with creative solutions on how to stop the leak or clean up the spill , and you 're using video to make these ideas come to life . Here are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream here , and if you have ideas you think BP should hear , submit them before 5 p.m .

Having already sold one million energy monitoring devices , Current Cost will now offer devices that are compatible with Google PowerMeter . They will also offer upgrades to existing customers so that they too can monitor their energy consumption anywhere online with our software . <p> Devices that integrate with Google PowerMeter will first be available in North America , the United Kingdom , Australia and New Zealand . Current Cost uses the Google PowerMeter API that we released back in March and joins others as a Featured Device partner that allows customers to understand their energy use . Our partnership is another example of hardware meeting our software to help customers save energy and money . <p> E.ON , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with Current Cost to offer its customers a Google PowerMeter compatible energy monitor as part of its free " Energy Fit Starter Pack . " <p> Current Cost estimates that their customers have already saved close to 400,000 tons of CO2 through monitoring their electricity use . One Australian restaurant recently learned that something as easy as turning off their coffee pots each night would save them $3,000 dollars per year . <p> Curious how you can start saving ? Sign up for Google PowerMeter today . <h> Tuesday 5/18/2010 08:26:00 PM <p> When creating Google Flu Trends , we decided early on to make all of our estimates of flu activity available to the public for download . Were always excited to hear about researchers using this data and recently learned about a study which compares Google Flu Trends estimates of flu activity with estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) . <p> Almost any public health expert will tell you that there is n't a single perfect measure of flu activity . Instead , there are several good measures , each of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flu activity emerges when these stories are examined together . One such measure is the CDCs influenza-like illness surveillance network ( ILINet ) which shows the proportion of people who visit a physician with flu-like symptoms such as fever , cough and sore throat . This network can highlight areas where activity is unusually high given the time of year but can not provide insight into the specific pathogens which are causing the illness . Another is the CDCs Virologic Surveillance which shows the proportion of people who visit a physician , get tested , and have lab-confirmed influenza . This network shows the specific strains of influenza in circulation but can be affected by changes in testing practices , making it difficult to interpret the data over long periods of time . <p> We collaborated with the CDC when designing Google Flu Trends and decided to build a system that would make estimates based on the CDCs ILINet data . Historically , we 've shown a strong correlation with CDCs ILINet data , typically with a correlation of greater than 0.9 ( or more than 90% accurate as compared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Google Flu Trends is 72% accurate as compared with CDC 's Virologic Surveillance data . This does n't come as much of a surprise since the virologic data is telling a different story than the ILInet data . However , its good to see research showing the differences in these measures , as it highlights the need for multiple networks to exist . <p> We provide Google Flu Trends as an additional source of information for helping to understand the flu season . Google Flu Trends helps paint the picture of flu activity by providing estimates daily while some traditional flu surveillance systems can take days or weeks to collect and release data . <h> Monday 5/03/2010 11:02:00 AM <p> ( Cross-posted from the Official Google Blog to bring you information on other green efforts at Google ) <p> On Friday we made our first direct investment in a utility-scale renewable energy project two wind farms that generate 169.5 megawatts of power , enough to power more than 55,000 homes . These wind farms , developed by NextEra Energy Resources , harness power from one of the worlds richest wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity to deliver clean energy to the region , reducing the use of fossil fuels . Through this $38.8 million investment , were aiming to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy in a way that makes good business sense , too . <p> To reach a clean energy future , we need three things : effective policy , innovative technology and smart capital . Through our philanthropic arm Google.org , we 've been pushing for energy policies that strengthen the innovation pipeline , and we 've been dedicating resources to developing new technologies , including making investments in early-stage renewable energy companies such as eSolar and AltaRock . Smart capital includes not only these early-stage company investments , but also dedicated funding for utility-scale projects . To tackle this need , we 've been looking at investments in renewable energy projects , like the one we just signed , that can accelerate the deployment of the latest clean energy technology while providing attractive returns to Google and more capital for developers to build additional projects . <p> A clear windy day at the Ashtabula II wind farm <p> Were excited about this first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turbine technology and control systems to provide one of the lowest-cost sources of renewable energy to the local grid . The turbines can continuously adjust the individual blade pitch angles to achieve optimal efficiency and use larger blades with 15 percent more swept area than earlier generations , allowing capture of even more wind energy for each turbine . The control systems for these wind farms are also advanced and dynamic , allowing for remote 24/7 monitoring and operation to ensure maximum turbine up-time and power production . A couple of us got a chance to climb 80 meters up one of the 113 turbines to see firsthand how the rotating blade motion goes through a gearbox to turn the generator that makes the electricity . The climb to the top also provided a great view of the entire wind farm ( do n't  worry we all had harnesses and turned the turbine off ! ) . <p> My colleague Matt takes a rest after the 80-meter climb <p> We look forward to finding more opportunities to invest in renewable energy projects that use the latest technologies to push the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know what we find .
