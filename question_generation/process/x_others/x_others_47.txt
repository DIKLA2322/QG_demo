The referendum is part of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed in 2005 ending the Civil War , which lasted 22 years and led to the deaths of an estimated 2 million people . Analysts fear the possibility of renewed violence . <p> Sudan is a huge country ( 2.5 million km2 ) , with an estimated population of 44 million people , but its poorly mapped . Without basic geospatial information , its difficult for humanitarian agencies and first responders to monitor and evaluate the risks and current needs , target their efforts , and mobilize proper resources . At times like these , it is critical to have good maps on roads , settlements , voting stations , hospitals , buildings and other services - with both local and official names - to generate better , faster responses . <p> If you have knowledge of Southern Sudan , an interest in mapping , and some free time , we encourage you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maker and Sudan Vote Monitor , you have the opportunity to take concrete action by improving the map , helping to monitor and report human rights violations in near-real time and providing insight into the socio-political climate prevalent in the country and region . <p> Global Call for Action:Together let 's build a better map of Southern Sudan . Your local knowledge and mapping contributions of schools , hospitals , and landmarks will be extremely useful to the humanitarian community to quickly build a picture of the situation , especially in these areas of interest . <p> Items that you can map : <p> Towns and town names ( Arabic and local names especially ) <p> Roads ( in-town roads as well ) and trails <p> Displaced persons camps <p> Cultural landmarks <p> Geographic landmarks <p> Schools <p> Orphanages , shelters etc . <p> Hospitals <p> Community centers <p> Border crossing points <p> Nomadic camps <p> Markets and large cattle gathering points <p> This is an opportunity to utilize the power of community engagement through mapping .
