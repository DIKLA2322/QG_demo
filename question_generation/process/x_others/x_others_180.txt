Once spoken by Native American communities throughout what 's now the American Midwest , its last fluent speakers died in the 1960s . Decades later , Daryl Baldwin , a citizen of the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma , began teaching himself the language from historical manuscripts and now works with the Miami University in Ohio to continue the work of revitalizing the language , publishing stories , audio files and other educational materials . Miami children are once again learning the language andeven more inspiringteaching it to each other . Daryls work is just one example of the efforts being made to preserve and strengthen languages that are on the brink of disappearing . <p> Today were introducing something we hope will help : the Endangered Languages Project , a website for people to find and share the most up-to-date and comprehensive information about endangered languages . Documenting the 3,000+ languages that are on the verge of extinction ( about half of all languages in the world ) is an important step in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and empowering our youth . Technology can strengthen these efforts by helping people create high-quality recordings of their elders ( often the last speakers of a language ) , connecting diaspora communities through social media and facilitating language learning . <p> The Endangered Languages Project , backed by a new coalition , the Alliance for Linguistic Diversity , gives those interested in preserving languages a place to store and access research , share advice and build collaborations . People can share their knowledge and research directly through the site and help keep the content up-to-date . A diverse group of collaborators have already begun to contribute content ranging from 18th-century manuscripts to modern teaching tools like video and audio language samples and knowledge-sharing articles . Members of the Advisory Committee have also provided guidance , helping shape the site and ensure that it addresses the interests and needs of language communities . <p> Google has played a role in the development and launch of this project , but the long-term goal is for true experts in the field of language preservation to take the lead . As such , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the First Peoples ' Cultural Council ( FPCC ) and The Institute for Language Information and Technology ( The LINGUIST List ) at Eastern Michigan University . FPCC will take on the role of Advisory Committee Chair , leading outreach and strategy for the project . The LINGUIST List will become the Technical Lead . Both organizations will work in coordination with the Advisory Committee . <p> As part of this project , research about the worlds most threatened languages is being shared by the Catalogue of Endangered Languages ( ELCat ) , led by teams at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and Eastern Michigan University , with funding provided by the National Science Foundation . Work on ELCat has only just begun , and were sharing it through our site so that feedback from language communities and scholars can be incorporated to update our knowledge about the worlds most at-risk languages . Building upon other efforts to preserve and promote culture online , Google.org has seeded this projects development . We invite interested organizations to join the effort . By bridging independent efforts from around the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endangerment . This projects future will be decided by those inspired to join this collaborative effort for language preservation . We hope you 'll join us.
