Whether its accessing information about the event , communicating with loved ones during a crisis or finding out how to help respond in the aftermath , the web plays a valuable role . <p> We looked up some statistics from our search data for several natural disasters to get insights into this phenomenon . We see two consistent trends in search behavior and internet use in the affected areas : a substantial ( and often dominant ) proportion of searches are directly related to the crises ; and people continue to search and access information online even while traffic and search levels drop temporarily during and immediately following the crises . While in some cases internet access is restricted due to infrastructure failures , generally Internet Service Providers continue to provide connectivity and users take advantage of it . The findings show just how resilient the internet can be in times of crises , compared to other infrastructure . <p> We expect these trends will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ongoing work of the Google Crisis Response team to improve the information available on the ' net during crises . <p> Joplin Tornado , Joplin , MO , USA , May 2011The week of this years tornadoes in Joplin , Missouri , searches for terms related to help , safety and recovery were significantly up from normal levels . Disaster relief was 2054 percent greater than normal and FEMA , American Red Cross , and National Weather Service showed increases of 400-1000% . Despite the tragedy , in which 25 percent of the town was destroyed and 75 percent damaged , we still saw search traffic at 58 percent of normal levels the day of the tornado , and an immediate recovery toward normal Internet traffic occured within a day of the event . <p> Hurricane Katrina , New Orleans , LA , USA , August 2005During Hurricane Katrina , one of the largest U.S. disasters in recent memory , terms like new orleans , hurricane and katrina topped search queries while search queries for resource providers like FEMA and the American Red Cross grew the fastest , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evacuated from New Orleans , we still saw search traffic at more than 50 percent of normal in Louisiana and 20% of normal in New Orleans , based on the previous five-day average . <p> The Internet has proven to be an essential resource during natural disasters internationally as well . <p> Japan Earthquake and Tsunami , Northern Coast , Japan , March , 2011During the Japan earthquake and tsunami , searches for earthquake information and impacts including terms like outage , tokyo electric power and rolling blackouts gew the fasted and also topped the list of most searched queries across Japan . In fact , even in the hardest hit areas , where mobile and landline communications were disrupted , Internet services were largely unaffected . During this time , people entered 620,000 records into Google Person Finder , a tool developed by the Google Crisis Response team to help people find missing friends and loved ones in the aftermath of such disasters . <p> Chile Earthquake , Maule Chile , February 2010 Immediately following the earthquake , people searching online were actively looking for earthquake information ; earthquake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 queries . Terremoto was the most searched term , and two online news sources , Terra and Emol , and the National Office for Emergencies onemi also appeared as top keywords . While there was no search traffic for 15 minutes after the earthquake , within one day searches had recovered to 25 percent of normal traffic , and search traffic returned to pre-earthquake levels within just four days . <p> Haiti Earthquake , Port-Au-Prince , Haiti , January 2010 The month of the Haiti earthquake , seismeor " earthquake " was the fastest-growing search term , and it continued its surface as a frequently searched term for almost two months after the earthquake . In the capital city of Port-Au-Prince , at the center of the earthquake , search traffic stopped momentarily , but did not completely disappear even when the three submarine Internet cables were cut as a result of the earthquake . As outlined by this U.S. Department of Homeland Security Communications Summary , Internet Service Providers were able to quickly reroute connections through a microwave relay wireless communication between Haiti and the Dominican Republic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and reach normal levels within a few months , despite ongoing damage to the city and countrys infrastructure . <p> Were excited about continuing our work to create and support products that make the Internet even more useful to people looking for information and communication during crises .
