In an evaluation of 76 countries , the OECD recently ranked the quality of Brazil 's education system 60th ; in a recent national math exam , 67% of 15-year-old Brazilian students had n't mastered basic concepts . Unfortunately , Brazil 's teachers often lack the resources and guidance they need to change these figures . <p> But the Brazilian Ministry of Education 's progress toward adopting the country 's first national education standards has created an unprecedented opportunity to use technology to help teachers help their students learn . Nova Escola will bring together teachers from across Brazil to create a set of digital lessons , videos , and other materials aligned to Brazil 's new national educational standards . Every lesson will include tips and advice from the teachers that created it , scaling the skills and wisdom of great educators across the country , and materials will be available via a free mobile and web app designed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Support from Google.org and the Lemann Foundation , a leading Brazilian education organization , will enable Nova Escola to develop the first-ever set of digital content " lessons , videos , and other materials " aligned with the new national standards for subjects including Math , Portuguese , and Humanities .

That 's the potential for Geothermal Energy in the United States , according to a recently completed 3-year project supported by Google.org to update the Geothermal Map of North America . <p> The project estimates that Technical Potential for the continental US exceeds 2,980,295 megawatts using Enhanced Geothermal Systems ( EGS ) and other advanced geothermal technologies such as Low Temperature Hydrothermal . <p> The SMU team has been developing entirely new pictures of the earth 's geothermal resources . They started by aggregating thousands of new Bottom Hole Temperature ( BHT ) readings from oil , gas , and water wells in previously under-sampled regions of the U.S. For example , The 2004 Geothermal Map of North America used only 5 heat flow points informing geothermal estimates for West Virginia , compared to the additional 1,455 BHT points in the updated version . In addition , the team has improved estimates of heat flow through the earth 's crust with better regional lithologic data .
