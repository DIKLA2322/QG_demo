The forum , now in its fourth year , is organized by Koji Omi , former Minster of Finance and Science and Technology of Japan . The dual theme of the forum was " returning to harmony with nature " and " innovation " . It examined the linked challenges of climate , energy , and water , together with impacts and contributions of the digital , biotechnology , and nanotechnology revolutions . <p> The new Japanese Prime Minister , Yasuo Fukuda , kicked off the meeting by stressing the need to make the transition to a sustainable society through science and technology . There was remarkable consensus in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest challenges we face . Science and technology helped humanity alter the face of the planet at an unprecedented rate , and human activities are now threatening the geo-bio-chemical systems on which all life on earth is based . Science and technology must now be deployed to help regain balance . <p> The most amazing side of the meeting is how " mainstream " this message has suddenly become . As a sustainable development professional , I have gone to environmentalist meetings with pretty much the same message for two decades . Then , however , I was preaching to the converted . Suddenly , mainstream leaders from government , business , and academia are now singing the same song . Al Gores film awakened an environmental consciousness in the general population , and it seems we have finally passed a tipping point ! To me that is great news . <p> There was debate on how to best balance the allocation of resources for climate change mitigation ( i.e. greenhouse gas emission reduction ) and for climate change adaptation ( i.e. increasing societys resilience in dealing with a changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who have contributed the least to global warming but will bear the brunt of its impact - particularly in Africa . There , farmers throughout the continent will face catastrophic crop losses due to increased droughts , people in the highlands of countries such as Ethiopia will be introduced to malaria and East African coastal countries will face sea level rise that can cost up to 10% of GDP . <p> I was there to give my perspective on water-related challenges for science and technology , and although only a handful of the participants shared my area of expertise , I was pleasantly surprised to see this meeting put in its final statement that , " Water , whether it is for drinking or for agriculture , is now one of the most pressing global issues we must deal with .

Want to learn about the role the private sector can play in international development ? Curious what it would be like to help a company based in a developing country address some of its most pressing strategic needs ? If your answer , like mine , is an emphatic yes , it 's not too late to apply for the Acumen Fund Fellows program , which is accepting applications until October 24 for its next class of fellows . <p> Acumen Fund , a non-profit venture capital fund based in New York City , invests in entrepreneurial approaches to reducing global poverty . In addition to providing capital , Acumen Fund offers management support to its investees through its year-long Fellows program . I joined the second annual class of Fellows in September to begin two months of orientation and training in New York . In the first four weeks of the program , the other Fellows and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders , discussed case studies of businesses working in developing countries , participated in leadership development activities , and begun to research the businesses to which we have been assigned . I will soon be heading out to work for an ambulance company in Mumbai , India to assist with its marketing strategy as it strives to meet the emergency medical needs of the city 's poorest . After nine months in the field , I will return to New York for a month to share the lessons I 've learned and wrap up the one-year fellowship program . <p> The program has attracted a diverse group of fellows from around the world who share an interest in meeting the needs of the poorest through sustainable private sector approaches . My own path to the Fellows program is as different as the rest of those in the program . After receiving my Masters degree in public policy with a focus on international development , I worked on a range of international economic issues as well as on development and foreign aid policy at the State Department , the US Treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Having worked on poverty from a high-level policy perspective , I was interested in getting back into the field and learning about the constraints that the private sector faces in developing countries . I was also curious to learn about innovative business approaches that seek to address poverty in a sustainable way . <p> While I have spent my career in government and diplomatic circles , the six other Fellows in the program come from completely different backgrounds . They have worked on microfinance in Kenya , design thinking to solve business problems , refugee resettlement , low-income housing development in Pakistan , and management and organizational consulting . Each of us brings a unique perspective to our discussions of business , international development , and leadership , creating a rich learning environment for all of us . <p> If you 're interested in applying for this unique program , you can find additional information here . <h> Monday 10/15/2007 08:38:00 AM <p> Last week the Nobel Foundation awarded Al Gore and the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) the Nobel Peace Prize . Former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on climate change and his Oscar winning documentary An Inconvenient Truth . The IPCC , a joint project of the United Nations Environment Program and the World Meteorological Organization , was honored for its efforts over the past two decades to educate the world about climate change . Earlier this year , the IPCC issued its strongest statement to date , finding the evidence of climate change " unequivocal " and concluding with 90% certainty that humans are the cause . <p> In awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to leaders in the battle against climate change , the Norwegian Nobel Committee emphasizes that the problem 's effects go beyond climate , and extend to individual security and opportunity . In the award press release they state : <p> " Indications of changes in the earth 's future climate must be treated with the utmost seriousness , and with the precautionary principle uppermost in our minds . Extensive climate changes may alter and threaten the living conditions of much of mankind . They may induce large-scale migration and lead to greater competition for the earth 's resources . Such changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulnerable countries . There may be increased danger of violent conflicts and wars , within and between states ... the Norwegian Nobel Committee is seeking to contribute to a sharper focus on the processes and decisions that appear to be necessary to protect the worlds future climate , and thereby to reduce the threat to the security of mankind . Action is necessary now , before climate change moves beyond mans control . " <p> Al Gore has argued for rising to meet the challenge of climate change from a moral perspective : " The climate crisis offers us the chance to experience what few generations in history have had the privilege of experiencing : a generational mission ; a compelling moral purpose ; a shared cause ; and the thrill of being forced by circumstances to put aside the pettiness and conflict of politics and to embrace a genuine moral and spiritual challenge . " <p> We agree wholeheartedly , and congratulate Al Gore and the IPCC on this historic recognition ! <h> 10/15/2007 07:57:00 AM <p> In partnership with Google.org , Technoserve recently completed the second Believe Begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its annual business plan competition . As a Google volunteer , I had an opportunity to interact with this years participants by teaching a class on presentation skills , judging the final round of the competition , and conducting one on one consulting sessions . I also visited the growing operations of 3 winners from last year and saw firsthand how the Believe Begin Become program has contributed to the success of their business . <p> I was both impressed and humbled by every entrepreneur I met . They all exhibited a level of energy , passion and enthusiasm that was overwhelmingly contagious . Operating in an environment where sound infrastructure is not a given , poverty is a reality , and health issues abound , they are seeking to create and build sustainable businesses that will change their community and their country for the better . <p> This years top winner of the overall business plan competition , Sheila Ocansey ( pictured below , left , with me , right ) , embodies this energy and passion . With FrutyFresh , she plans to package and distribute quality fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sheila was thoughtful enough to bring a sample of her product to her oral presentation , something that impressed all of the judges . I craved FrutyFresh fruit for its freshness , quality , and taste throughout the rest of my stay in Ghana . The other top winners include : Darko Abednego , Stanley Adjei , Yaw Agyei-Henaku , Joseph Brenyah , Savior Deikumah , Nikoe Gavu , Mary Koranteng , Daniel Oduro , and Joseph Tettey . <p> I observed firsthand the promise of what is possible for this years winners through visits with three winners from last year . Nicholas Vordzgbe of City Wash launched his mobile car wash service using a highly profitable , environmentally friendly approach to a common activity . City Wash is capable of washing an SUV with just 2 liters of water ! His next move includes opening a point of service location and expanding his mobile activities . Isaac Bohulu launched Natural Scientific Pharmaceuticals in a style characteristic of Silicon Valley . In a room that should have been his master bedroom , he is running a government approved production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made from completely natural ingredients . Finally , last years overall winner , Joseph Tackie of MeatyFoods , showed us how a shift in his marketing strategy allowed him to quintuple his revenues in one month . While we sampled the butchers spicy sausage , he told us of his plans to open his second store . <p> The Believe Begin Become program was launched with the hope that we would create an ecosystem of entrepreneurs , investors , customers , and employees that contribute to the growth and economic development of Ghana . Participating in the judging process , seeing the operations in action , and spending time with the entrepreneurs provided evidence that this is exactly what is happening . Participants from last year have become customers and/or suppliers of each other . Last years winner was a mentor to at least 3 of the winners from this year . The judges and potential investors have high standards ; not only are they funding these businesses , but they are personally engaged and interested in their success .

Back in 2008 , a team at Google dug into this behavior and found that certain search terms were good indicators of flu levels . We later launched Google Flu Trends to estimate flu activity in near real-time using aggregated Google search data , in regions around the world . <p> At the end of every flu season , we evaluate the performance of our model . Are our estimates accurate ? What worked well , or not so well ? Do we need to make any updates ? After the 2009 H1N1 season , for example , we updated the model to make sure we were providing accurate estimates . Since 2009 , the model had performed well at the national and regional levels in the US and no update was needed . <p> Flu Trends can help estimate the start , peak , and duration of each flu season--all important information for public health agencies . During the 2012-2013 season in the US , the model performed well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , the model overestimated the severity of the flu . In January 2013 , after spotting the difference between our estimates and the percentage of healthcare visits for influenza-like illnesses ( ILI ) reported by the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) , we started to investigate the high estimates . We found that heightened media coverage on the severity of the flu season resulted in an extended period in which users were searching for terms we 've identified as correlated with flu levels . In early 2013 , we saw more flu-related searches in the US than ever before . <p> We evaluated several options to improve the model . Ultimately , we determined that an update using the peak from the 2012-2013 season provided a close approximation of flu activity for recent seasons . We will be applying this update to the US flu level estimates for the 2013-2014 flu season , starting from August 1st . A casual observer will see that the new model forecasts a lower flu level than last years model did at a similar time in the season . We believe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can check out the new models estimates against previous years flu levels in this graph : <p> For those of you who want more data and details , we presented this paper recently at the ISNTD Bites conference .

In the meantime , stay healthy ! <h> Wednesday 10/23/2013 12:02:00 PM <p> A catastrophe or natural disaster can occur when least expected . That 's why the Google Crisis Response Team created Public Alerts and Crisis Map to help people better prepare for these unfortunate situations . Today , were launching Google Public Alerts and Crisis Map in Colombia to provide people with access to useful information before , during , and after a natural disaster such as a tropical storm , hurricane , flood or landslide.Starting today , relevant information about extreme weather changes which threaten the safety of Colombians will appear on Google Public Alerts as well as emergency related information for impacted areas on Crisis Map . This information will also be displayed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Google Now . Our goal at Google Crisis Response is to provide citizens with the critical information needed in an emergency . Were able to provide Public Alerts and Crisis Map in Colombia thanks to the support of the Colombian Institute of Hydrology , Meteorology and Environmental Studies ( IDEAM ) and the National Unit for Disaster Risk Management ( UNGRD ) . Colombia is the first country in Latin America to implement the system . Public Alerts is currently available in five other countries : Australia , Canada , Japan , Taiwan , and the United States . <p> Google Public Alerts and Crisis Map <p> Google Public Alerts helps you find important weather information without even looking for it by bringing together critical alert information for weather , landslides and floods , and providing instructions for severe weather conditions and non-weather alerts such as missing persons , wildfires and earthquakes .

Colombias Crisis Map , shown below , provides various layers of information such as public alerts , shelters and crisis response centers in the impacted area . This is a valuable resource for people who live in or near the impacted area , and for crisis response teams who need access to reliable information . <p> Google Crisis Map for Colombia <p> The goal of Google Public Alerts and Crisis Map is to make it easier to find specific information during emergencies when people are already using Google products .

That 's why we 've launched aGoogle Crisis Mapto show fire information across five Australian states and territories.The Google Crisis Mapshows information about current fires including their location and size the level of alert , whether the fire is under control and which local emergency response agency is responding to the crisis . Working with fire authorities across Australia , the Crisis Map is continually updated and can be accessed from any device connected to the web at **30;406;TOOLONG . <p> Example of a fire warning and fire incidents on the Google Crisis Map <p> In addition to the Crisis Map , Google Public Alerts is now also available for NSW .

Could you pay ? What might you have to give up ? For billions of people , these costs--and questions--are an unaffordable reality that stop them from accessing the Web . <p> Today , Google is joining more than 30 members to launch the Alliance for Affordable Internet ( A4AI ) , a new coalition that cuts across boundaries of geography , sector , or size . Our goal ? To help bring down Internet costs through policy change . <p> New technologies play a crucial role in bringing the Internet to more people worldwide--weve developed and invested in many of these big ideas over the years . We broke new ground with balloon-powered Internet access , are bringing broadband to Africa with TV White Spaces , and are funding organizations like the Internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> These technologies can have major impact , but no single solution can connect the 5 billion people living without Internet access today . Policy change can help new innovation take hold and flourish ; outdated policies can stifle progress . In Kenya and other markets that have adopted national broadband plans , policy change has delivered results , fast . A4AI will focus on those policy changes that can bolster new access technologies and initiatives and make the Internet more affordable to people worldwide . <p> Initiated by the World Wide Web Foundation , A4AI includes members from the technology , government , and nonprofit worlds , from developed and developing countries . Google--along with other Global Sponsors--joined the alliance in its early days to help establish the vision that exists today , as well as rally more members that share our mission for affordable Internet access . <p> A4AI has a specific goal in mind : to reach the UN Broadband Commission target of entry-level broadband access priced at less than 5% of monthly income worldwide . ( According to the ITU , households in the developing world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so there 's a lot of work to do . ) Were working with A4AI on several initial projects , including : <p> Working directly with governments , with plans to engage with 10+ countries by the end of 2015 <p> Releasing the first edition of an annual affordability report <p> Ultimately , A4AI is about making the world a more connected place . Over 90% of people in the 49 least developed countries are still not online . A4AI wants to help people in these countries to get access , to find a door to new information , opportunities , and ideas . Dr. Bitange Ndemo , the honorary chairperson of A4AI , has called for the need to remove " analog policies that are holding back the digital revolution " in emerging markets .
