@@13269114 @1869114/ <h> Monday 12/20/2010 01:20:00 PM <p> At Google , were committed to building a clean energy future because we we want to be good environmental stewards , and because we think it makes business sense . We 've had a busy year with our clean energy initiatives . Take look at our redesigned green website and this new video from the Google green team to learn more about the priorities were pursuing : <p> As we look back on 2010 , we wanted to highlight what we 've been working on this year to help build a more sustainable futurefor Google , and the world . <p> Greening our operations . We already have the most energy efficient data centers in the world , and use renewable energy whenever possible . This year we created a subsidiary , Google Energy LLC , to enable us to purchase renewable energy on the wholesale power markets and to help spur development in the sector . <p> 20-year green power purchase . Our FERC authority enabled Google Energy LLC to enter a 20-year green Power Purchase Agreement ( PPA ) in July to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation at NextEras Story County II facility in Iowa ( read more about how the deal is structured ) . By purchasing so much energy for so long , were giving the developer financial certainty to build additional clean energy projects . <p> Developing green products and tools . Just a few weeks ago , during the the U.N . Climate Change Conference in sunny Cancun , Mexico , we launched Google Earth Engine , a new Google Labs product . Google Earth Engine is a technology platform that makes an unprecedented catalog of imagery and data available online in one place for the first time . It enables global-scale monitoring and measurement of changes in the earths environment . Were particularly excited about the initial use of Google Earth Engine to support efforts to stop global deforestation . We 've also been busy this year incorporating green features into our productslike Google Maps biking directions and adding Carbon Disclosure Project ratings into Google Finance . <p> Investing in a clean energy future . To date , Google has invested over $100 million in clean energy . Google.org has already invested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal R&amp;D on renewable energy technologies ( RE&lt;C ) , substantially growing our engineering team . And this year , Google began making project investments that offer a solid financial return , and could have a transformational impact on the renewable energy sector . <p> North Dakota wind farms . In May , we invested $38.8 million in two North Dakota wind farms that generate 169.5MW , enough to power 55,000 homes . It was our first project investment , and uses some of the latest wind turbine technology and control systems to provide one of the lowest-cost sources of renewable energy to the local grid . <p> Offshore wind transmission . In October , we made a development stage investment in a project to build a backbone transmission line off the Mid-Atlantic coast . The project will put in place strong , secure transmission , removing a major barrier to scaling up offshore wind . When finished , the 350-mile line will connect up to 6,000MW of offshore wind energyenough to serve approximately 1.9 million households ! <p> Its been a busy year at Google , and we believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we head into the new year , we look forward to continuing our work to find and support innovative clean energy solutions . <h> 12/20/2010 12:55:00 PM <p> In September we announcedHealth Speaks , an initiative to make more quality health information available in local languages on the Internet . We began by launching three pilots for which people crowd-sourced translation of English Wikipedia health articles into Arabic , Hindi and Swahili . <p> After an inspiring 3.5 months , these pilots have come to a close . Health Speaks communities translated , reviewed and published 266 new health articles ( 177 in Arabic , 79 in Hindi and 10 in Swahili ) . My colleague , Dr. Joanne Stevens , and I met hundreds of enthusiastic volunteers , and heard powerful stories about the importance of local language health information . We 've also learned invaluable lessons about providing tools that allow for community coordination and easy and accurate translation . <p> While we iterate on our future approach for crowd-sourcing the translation of health content , there are still many ways to contribute to the goals of Health Speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health information to consider one or more of the following : <p> Lastly , we would like to give a special mention to the many Wikipedians who worked with us by training others and providing help with Wikipedia , as well as to our top contributors for each pilot . <p> Were already seeing evidence of the impact of our volunteers hard work . For example , three reproductive health-related articles in Arabic have been viewed over 20,000 times . Articles from the Health Speaks pilots ( including the professionally translated articles commissioned by Google.org ) have been viewed over 145,000 times . We think its a great first step towards making important health information accessible online in all languages . <h> Friday 12/17/2010 09:58:00 AM <p> The past couple of years have been a challenging stretch for charitable organizations as giving tends to decline during economic downturns when the need is highest . Charitable giving was down 3.6% in 2009 , only the second year there 's been a drop since Giving USA began their reports in 1956 . We continue to be inspired , however , by organizations that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ todays challenges . Were grateful for the millions of Google users who helped continue our success in 2010 , and we want to do our part to help charitable organizations that are working tirelessly to meet increased need with decreased funding . <p> In this spirit , our global sales team led by Nikesh Arora is giving a $20 million holiday gift that will provide : <p> Strategic support and online tools for 1.5 million social entrepreneurs through partners including Ashoka , NTEN , APC and LASA . <p> Environmental education in the National Parks for 40,000 students through NatureBridge . <p> We will exceed our 2010 target this year with charitable giving , with more than $145 million going to non-profits and academic institutions , and more than $184 million in total giving when including Google Grants , Google.org technology projects and product support for non-profits . Some of our major initiatives include : <p> Supporting science and math education and education reform through partners including New Schools Venture , Teach for All , Citizens Schools and Posse Foundation . We provide scholarships to help dismantle barriers that keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We also support the next generation of engineers and maintain strong ties with academic institutions worldwide that are pursuing research in areas relevant to our mission . <p> To keep up with Googlers generosity in their personal giving , we also increased our charitable matching to $12,000 per employee . We thank our partners and all those who use Google for their continued business and wish everyone a happy , healthy holiday season . <h> Wednesday 12/15/2010 06:55:00 PM <p> *Update , December 15 at 17:15 PT : The 48 hour period of Project for Awesome starts at 9am PT / noon ET on Friday , December 17 , and the live stream will take place from 4pm to 7pm PT on Saturday , December 18. * <p> Three years ago , the vlogbrothers Hank and John kick-started an initiative called Project for Awesome , which called for YouTube users across the world to " take over YouTube " by creating videos that promote their favorite charities and causes . Project for Awesome built on its initial success again in 2008 , resulting in thousands of user submissions and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web to make the world more awesome for the holidays . Hank and John upped the ante last year by increasing community participation , making Project for Awesome ( #p4a ) one of the top trending topics on Twitter in December 2009 . <p> Project for Awesome 2010 officially begins on December 17 at 12:01 AM , when users are encouraged to upload videos for their favorite causes and charities . To celebrate the end of Project for Awesome on Saturday , December 18 , join us for a live show on YouTube at www.youtube.com/p4a . Were teaming up with the vlogbrothers , some of YouTubes biggest stars like daneboe of Annoying Orange , Michelle Phan , Phil DeFranco , Michael Buckley , Shay Carl , and iJustine , and prominent nonprofit organizations to broadcast a four hour live show from 4 - 8pm PST . The live show involves a wide array of entertainment : from musical performances to user-generated games to special moments that only YouTube can bring . Moreover , this year , Project for Awesome will focus on raising awareness and encouraging action in four areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childrens wish-giving . <p> And , as in past years , were encouraging the global YouTube community to create videos on behalf of these charities and the causes you 're most passionate about . Post them to your site , tweet them , put them on Facebook - do whatever you can to spread the awesome this holiday season . We look forward to seeing what you create , and hope you join us online this Saturday for a ton of awesomeness ! <h> Thursday 12/02/2010 08:00:00 AM <p> Today , we launched a new Google Labs product called Google Earth Engine at the International Climate Change Conference in sunny Cancun , Mexico . Google Earth Engine is a new technology platform that puts an unprecedented amount of satellite imagery and datacurrent and historicalonline for the first time . It enables global-scale monitoring and measurement of changes in the earths environment . The platform will enable scientists to use our extensive computing infrastructurethe Google " cloud " to analyze this imagery . Last year , we demonstrated an early prototype . Since then , we have developed the platform , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Earth Engine to implement their applications . <p> Why is this important ? The images of our planet from space contain a wealth of information , ready to be extracted and applied to many societal challenges . Scientific analysis can transform these images from a mere set of pixels into useful informationsuch as the locations and extent of global forests , detecting how our forests are changing over time , directing resources for disaster response or water resource mapping . <p> The challenge has been to cope with the massive scale of satellite imagery archives , and the computational resources required for their analysis . As a result , many of these images have never been seen , much less analyzed . Now , scientists will be able to build applications to mine this treasure trove of data on Google Earth Engine , providing several advantages : <p> Landsat satellite data archives over the last 25 years for most of the developing world available online , ready to be used together with other datasets including MODIS . And we will soon offer a complete global archive of Landsat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructure . By running analyses across thousands of computers , for example , unthinkable tasks are now possible for the first time . <p> New features that will make analysis easier , such as tools that pre-process the images to remove clouds and haze . <p> Collaboration and standardization by creating a common platform for global data analysis . <p> Google Earth Engine can be used for a wide range of applicationsfrom mapping water resources to ecosystem services to deforestation . Its part of our broader effort at Google to build a more sustainable future . Were particularly excited about an initial use of Google Earth Engine to support development of systems to monitor , report and verify ( MRV ) efforts to stop global deforestation . <p> Deforestation releases a significant amount of carbon into the atmosphere , accounting for 12-18% of annual greenhouse gas emissions . The world loses 32 million acres of tropical forests every year , an area the size of Greece . The United Nations has proposed a framework known as REDD ( Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries ) that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forests . Reaching an agreement on early development of REDD is a key agenda item here in Cancun . <p> Today , we announced that we are donating 10 million CPU-hours a year over the next two years on the Google Earth Engine platform , to strengthen the capacity of developing world nations to track the state of their forests , in preparation for REDD . For the least developed nations , Google Earth Engine will provide critical access to terabytes of data , a growing set of analytical tools and our high-performance processing capabilities . We believe Google Earth Engine will bring transparency and more certainty to global efforts to stop deforestation . <p> Weve been working with several partners to fully develop this platform . In particular , the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation has been a key strategic and funding partner . The Moore Foundation has also committed over $12 million dollars through its Environmental Conservation Program to projects that support the development of Google Earth Engine . The Moore Foundations Environment Program finances practical , enduring solutions to environmental challenges and works to improve the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coastal marine ecosystems to create working land and seascapes that support resilient and productive ecosystems for current and future generations . Theyve funded the U.S. Geological Survey to scale their infrastructure and accelerate bringing historic Landsat data off tape , and online , through Google Earth Engine . <p> This animation shows the breadth and depth of the Landsat archive that has been uploaded into Google Earth Engine to date . We are grateful to the USGS for their ongoing technical collaboration . <p> Support from the Moore Foundation includes funding for several scientists to develop and integrate their desktop software to work online with the data available in Google Earth Engine . Those scientists -- Greg Asner of the Carnegie Institution for Science and Carlos Souza of Imazon -- are also key partners , along with Matt Hansen of the Geographic Information Science Center at South Dakota State University . All are at the cutting edge of forest monitoring in support of climate science . <p> In collaboration with Matt Hansen and CONAFOR , Mexicos National Forestry Commission , we 've produced a forest cover and water map of Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to date . The map required 15,000 hours of computation , but was completed in less than a day on Google Earth Engine , using 1,000 computers over more than 53,000 Landsat scenes ( 1984-2010 ) . CONAFOR provided National Forest Inventory ground-sampled data to calibrate and validate the algorithm . <p> A forest cover and water map of Mexico ( southern portion , including the Yucatan peninsula ) , produced in collaboration with scientist Matthew Hansen and CONAFOR . <p> We hope that Google Earth Engine will be an important tool to help institutions around the world manage forests more wisely . As we fully develop the platform , we hope more scientists will use new Earth Engine API to integrate their applications onlinefor deforestation , disease mitigation , disaster response , water resource mapping and other beneficial uses . If you 're interested in partnering with us , we want to hear from youvisit our website ! We look forward to seeing what 's possible when scientists , governments , NGOs , universities , and others gain access to data and computing resources to collaborate online to help protect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Moore Foundation , Google Earth Engines Landsat archive , and the Congo Basin Water Map have been added to the post . <h> Wednesday 12/01/2010 10:00:00 AM <p> Occasionally , we invite distinguished guests to contribute to our blogs and were very happy to have Wangari Maathai share her perspective here . In collaboration with Wangari Maathais Green Belt Movement and several other partners , the Google Earth Outreach team has created several narrated tours on the topic of climate change in preparation for the UNFCCCs COP16 Climate Summit 2010 in Cancun , Mexico . Fly underwater to learn about the effects of ocean acidification on sea life with Oceana . Zoom around Mexican mangroves in 3D and learn about the importance of this biodiverse habitat ... and what must be done to protect it for future generations . Visit **42;763;TOOLONG to experience these tours . -Ed . <p> Ask most people what trees mean to them and the first thing that comes to mind is the tree outside their bedroom window or the forest where they played as a child . Trees do occupy a powerful place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect our worlds trees is not based on sentiment . There is a vital interdependency between communities and the trees they rely on for survival . Trees are our watersheds , protectors of the natural environment , and sources of food . Remove the trees from the equation and the community feels the impact . <p> I came to this realization in the 1970s in Kenya . I was talking to women in my community about their problems : hunger , access to water , poverty , wood fuel . I saw a link between their needs and the condition of the land and thought , " Why not plant trees to address these issues ? " Trees hold the soil to the ground so that we can grow food in it , they protect watersheds and facilitate harvesting of rain water , fruits trees supplement food and trees give us domestic energy and wood with which to build our shelters . So while still working at the University of Nairobi , I established a tree nursery in my backyard , planted seven trees at a public park and founded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities , to build their capacity to restore Africa 's forests and put an end to the problems that deforestation and other forms of environmental degradation cause . As a result of this idea , more than 40 million trees have been planted to restore the environment and improve the lives of the people who are linked to the land . <p> When we were offered a unique opportunity to partner with the Google Earth Outreach team on a project using new Google Earth technology to visualize trees in 3D , we were thrilled . For accuracy and integrity we worked very closely with Google , advising them on the modeling of unique African trees like the broad-leaved Croton , the Nile tulip tree and the East African Cordia . These tree models illustrate the biodiversity in our tree planting sites , especially in the forests , and how we carefully select trees that are indigenous and sustainable to the natural surroundings . <p> Broad-leaved Croton , the Nile tulip tree and the East African Cordia ( from left to right ) <p> We then used data from real planting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth and create 3D visualizations . Now , for the first time in Google Earth , people from all over the world will be able to virtually visit these planting sites , explore the 3D trees and connect with the work that we are doing . <p> Green Belt Movement planting site in 3D on Google Earth <p> Tree planting is a simple activity with tangible results , and anyone can participate . It helps people come together to address common problems and work collectively towards community improvement and sustainability . I hope that seeing our beautiful tree planting sites in 3D on Google Earth will be a source of inspiration for people to engage , plant trees and organize planting activities in their own communities . Taking charge of our lives and the environment around us can help ensure a lasting legacy and healthy future for our children .
