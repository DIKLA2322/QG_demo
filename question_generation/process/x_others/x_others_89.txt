@@13268980 @1868980/ <h> Thursday 2/24/2011 10:52:00 AM <p> I lead a global team at Google and travel extensively . When I speak about my work , the questions I get are often about the efforts we make to bring more women into engineering and how I maintain my work/life balance with two young children . These are very important questions , but I 'm acutely aware that they reflect a certain amount of privilege when it comes to issues of womens equality . Despite the incredible advances women have made in the last century , many around the world are still struggling to provide for their families and keep them safe amidst violence and instability . <p> For the past several years I 've been part of a sponsorship program administered by Women for Women International , an organization dedicated to helping women survivors of war rebuild their lives . Every time I receive a letter from a woman I sponsor , each of whom is determined to improve her life despite the terrible odds she faces , I 'm reminded of why its so important that we allwomen and men alikerecognize the challenges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I 'm so excited to celebrate the centenary of International Womens Day on March 8 , 2011 . This year Google is collaborating with Women for Women International on their " Join me on the Bridge " campaign . Originally conceived of by women from Rwanda and Congo as a sign of solidarity between women in two conflict-ridden countries , last years campaign brought together thousands of women and men at more than 100 bridge events on four continents . <p> This year were making it simple for you , your friends , your classmates and your colleagues to participate in bridge events on International Womens Day by offering new online resources . <p> To attend a bridge event , check our map to see all the events that have already been planned . Or you can use our event toolkit to plan your own event on the bridge of your choice . You 'll see that there are two kinds of eventsphysical and online ; if you 're not able to attend a bridge event in person on March 8 , you can lend your support online by virtually attending an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on our International Womens Day 2011 site , you can to donate to Women for Women International and more than 40 other incredible organizations working in the fields of womens economic security , education , empowerment , equality , health and safety . <h> Tuesday 2/22/2011 04:22:00 PM <p> The terrible earthquake which struck Christchurch yesterday has shocked us all . As a Kiwi now living in New York , I 've been anxious for everyone affected in New Zealand and simultaneously encouraged by how quickly people have come together to help . <p> We know that a lot of people are trying to contact the people they love and care about to make sure they 're OK ; we also know that during a time of crisis , it can be very difficult to reach people . <p> We have launched Google Person Finder to help people connect with their loved ones . Person Finder is a simple application which allows people to check on and update the status of relatives or friends affected by a disaster . <p> Working with a small team of Googlers in New Zealand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with maps , videos and other resources , including a real-time news stream . The link for that page can now be found on the google.co.nz homepage and emergency information will appear on top of the results page for those in New Zealand searching for relevant terms . <h> 2/15/2011 04:50:00 PM <p> After years of conflict , Southern Sudan overwhelmingly opted to secede from the country 's north . Many challenges lie ahead as the newly independent state negotiates the rocky path towards independence . We believe that access to high-quality , up-to-date and locally relevant maps will assist humanitarian organizations working in the region . <p> We are encouraging users to add their local knowledge to this mapping effort through a campaign to build a better map of Sudan . Recent satellite imagery is key to building up-to-date maps , and we are continuously acquiring fresh and historical imagery of Sudan . Our latest imagery update is now live on Google Map Maker , Google Earth , and Google Maps , with nearly fifty percent of the UN priority areas over Southern Sudan covered with high resolution imagery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to acquire and publish high resolution imagery of the remaining UN priority areas , as well as to refresh areas that we have previously covered as the need arises . This new imagery , such as the one over Melut , will directly benefit the many organizations working in Sudan and ultimately support the building of a solid basemap of Sudan to achieve long-term socioeconomic objectives . <p> Town of Melut ( before 2/16/2004 , after 1/30/2011 ) . In Melut , there is a humanitarian hub where many services are delivered to at risk populations , including food , water , health care , education , and more . Given the varying needs of each of these services , maps can provide a variety of planning benefits for expansion , staff safety , and emergency procedures . <p> Google is also contributing to various humanitarian efforts , including the Satellite Sentinel project , by helping to build an active and self-sustained Sudanese mapping community -- locally and among the Sudanese diaspora . This community will help improve maps of Sudan by using Google Map Maker , a product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Dedicated mappers have started building the foundation for a Sudan mapping community , resulting in high quality maps of Sudan . But this is a long term process that requires deep commitment from various stakeholders and community groups . To join the Sudan mapping efforts , and offer feedback , please join our Sudan community mailing list or visit our team site . <h> 2/15/2011 08:00:00 AM <p> In an effort to foster a more open , transparent and accessible scientific dialogue , we 've started a new effort aimed at inspiring pioneering use of technology , new media and computational thinking in the communication of science to diverse audiences . Initially , well focus on communicating the science on climate change . <p> Were kicking off this effort by naming 21 Google Science Communication Fellows . These fellows were elected from a pool of applicants of early to mid-career Ph.D . scientists nominated by leaders in climate change research and science-based institutions across the U.S. It was hard to choose just 21 fellows from such an impressive pool of scientists ; ultimately , we chose scientists who had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training in science communication ; research in topics related to understanding or managing climate change ; and experience experimenting with innovative approaches or technology tools for science communication . This years fellows are an impressive bunch : <p> Brendan Bohannan , Associate Professor of Environmental Studies and Biology , University of Oregon <p> Edward Brook , Professor , Department of Geosciences , Oregon State University <p> Julia Cole , Professor , Department of Geosciences , University of Arizona <p> Whendee Silver , Professor , Ecosystem Ecology and Biogeochemistry , University of California-Berkeley <p> Alan Townsend , Professor , Ecology and Evolutionary Biology , University of Colorado <p> At our Mountain View , Calif. headquarters in June , the fellows will participate in a workshop , which will integrate hands-on training and facilitated brainstorming on topics of technology and science communication . Following the workshop , fellows will be given the opportunity to apply for grants to put their ideas into practice . Those with the most impactful projects will be given the opportunity to join a Lindblad Expeditions &amp; National Geographic trip to the Arctic , the Galapagos or Antarctica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fellows ! And well keep you posted on more ideas and tools emerging for science communication . <h> 2/01/2011 09:15:00 PM <p> We continue to follow the fast-changing events in Egypt , hopeful that compiling vital information in one place helps people on the ground and their anxious relatives and friends . We just posted the first version of a resource page in response to the need for information such as emergency hotlines , embassy phone numbers , and recent updates about the unrest in Egypt . We plan to translate the page into Arabic and will continue adding useful information . <p> As has been widely reported , Internet access is limited inside Egypt . We hope that the resources on this page will be valuable for those in touch with friends and family on the ground and others simply eager to find information . We believe that access to information is a fundamental global right . YouTube is helping people access and share footage from the demonstrations . We also teamed up with Twitter to turn on a speak-to-tweet service that helps people in Egypt stay connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those in Egypt . <p> Posted by Essam El-Dardiry , Technical Program Manager , Middle East and North Africa and Ahmad Hamzawi , Head of Engineering , Middle East and Africa
