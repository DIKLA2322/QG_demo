Floods , hurricanes , heatwaves , and droughts nearly always bring with them various threats to public health including the emergence and spread of infectious diseases . However , these threats now loom even larger with the expected rise in the frequency and intensity of extreme events as a result of the Earths changing climate . <p> In times of disaster our vulnerabilities are revealed . While the recent extreme events can not be directly attributed to climate change , they are omens of what lie ahead and their devastating impacts raise serious questions about societys vulnerability to , and its ability to cope with continued climate change . <p> The good news is that environmental and health scientists are beginning to work together to get us ahead of the curve and prepare for the changes underway by designing new analytical tools , providing access to real-time data , and developing forecasts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephen Connor at the International Research Institute for Climate and Society ( IRI ) have developed a Summer Institute 2008 on Climate Information for Public Health . This institute offers people the opportunity to learn practical methods for integrating climate knowledge and information into public health decision-making . <p> Yesterday the National Press Club hosted scientists at an event examining the challenges and opportunities to predict and protect global public health from our changing climate . These are the same challenges and opportunities that the Predict and Prevent Initiative seeks to support . Our own Frank Rijsberman participated in the event and outlined Google.orgs efforts to support projects that advance the use of climate and weather information to help predict and prevent emerging infectious diseases . You can watch the panel Frank participated in , " Changing Climate , Changing Health Patterns : What will it take to Predict and Protect ? " here . <p> The Associated Press covered the event with an in-depth article . It 's encouraging to see this growing interest in health as a part of the climate change discussion , especially given the WHO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health . <h> 6/20/2008 09:56:00 AM <p> Posted by Meryl Stone , Associate , Google.org <p> A recent field visit took me to Kisii , a Kenyan town close to the shores of Lake Victoria . The population has swelled to 100,000 from approximately 70,000 largely because of refugees fleeing the post-election violence in other parts of Kenya . Local authorities expect to see that population double over the next ten years . Providing public services , especially water and sanitation , to this growing population is an enormous challenge . <p> In 2000 , the international community made a commitment to the UN Millennium Development Goals to help communities access basic public services , like health , education , water and sanitation . One the key milestones of Goal 7 is to " halve the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015 . " As of 2004 , the MDG Monitor shows the nations bordering Lake Victoria- Uganda , Tanzania and Kenya only 60% of their populations have access to improved drinking water sources . <p> While great progress is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60% of their population has adequate service , despite what the official statistics say . New water pipes have been donated to the local water provider . This has doubled the capacity , but it only reaches half of Kisii 's estimated population ( 50,000 ) . Water kiosks stand proudly along the main road . And yet , the taps run dry . The connections to the main line are not even functional . Young women still trudge the kilometers to the river , at risk to their own security , to collect water . Bright blue toilet stalls line the periphery of a girls school . While the school has seen an increase in attendance since the installation of these toilets , they continue to be plagued by their inability to deal with the sanitation requirements of their students . As we depart , the headmistress of the school pleads with us to help with the sanitation problem . <p> Some more recent data gathered from towns surrounding Lake Victoria in Uganda , Tanzania and Kenya , tell us a very different story than information from the MDG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us on the ground : while basic infrastructure ( water pipes , points , toilets ) may exist , those facilities are rarely functional , affordable or accessible , indicating to us that access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation services is substantially lower than many think . Presented with this information at a recent UN-Habitat meeting in Nairobi , international donors and development agencies were astonished . They asked , " how come we did n't know about this earlier ? " <p> And yet , unsurprisingly , the people of Kisii have long known that they do n't have appropriate water and sanitation services . They may not have even heard of the MDG 's . They are likely unaware of the conversations that transpire amongst donors and development agencies and help shape where resources are allocated . They are having their own conversations about what they need . But who can they tell ? Who hears their voices ? <p> Our challenge going forward is to help amplify these voices and contribute to efforts to inform these local discussions . <h> 6/13/2008 07:35:00 AM <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Google.org-Brookings Institution conference was punctuated by a panel moderated by Tom Friedman . The lively discussion covered topics including policy leadership , innovative business models , the potential for plug-ins to become greener over time , and the security and stability of the grid . Two important themes emerged the importance of plug-ins and clean energy for U. S. economic competitiveness and the policy and leadership needed to make this industry transformation a reality.Jon Wellinghoff , Commissioner of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ( FERC ) , surprised many in the audience by describing the 40 million electric vehicles on the road today in China ( many of which are scooters ) and emphatically argued that the grid is ready for plug-ins today . John Podesta , President of the Center for American Progress , credited Germanys feed-in tariff with creating a vibrant solar industry in Germany and causing the U. S. market share of the global solar industry to decline from 45% to 10% . Assistant Secretary of Energy Andy Karsnerannounced a $30 million Department of Energy investment in plug-in vehicle technology . Sue Tierney talked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Washington at the state level and within the business community . Finally , Congressman Jay Inslee inspired the crowd by suggesting that we need visionary leadership on plug-in vehicles and renewable energy , likening the climate crisis to the challenge put forth by John F. Kennedy when he launched the Apollo program to put a man on the moon in 10 years . <h> Wednesday 6/11/2008 04:07:00 PM <p> Posted by Jenny Kwan , Climate and Energy Intern , Google.org <p> Hundreds of participants gathered today in Washington , DC as the Google.org - Brookings Institution conference kicked off . It was exciting to be able to see , in person , the latest electric car technology . <p> Outside the hotel we talked to Patrick from GM about their new Chevy Volt . If you look for it you can also spot the A123 car in the background . <p> Inside the conference room , I got to check out the latest Tesla . Unfortunately it 's a little out of my price range ... <p> I also met a bunch of people from around the US and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Felix Kramer with CalCars who was one of the first to bring electric vehicles to Washington DC many years ago : <p> And Seth from New York and Lars from Sweden were here to check out the crowd and learn about the latest news and technology : <h> 6/11/2008 03:50:00 PM <p> Posted by David Bercovich , Program Manager , Google.org <p> On another day of record-high gas prices , the Google.org/Brookings Institution conference on plug-in vehicles kicked off in Washington , DC today . Electrifying transportation impacts our economy , national security , and environment , and conference sessions overflowed with interested attendees . The lively afternoon session highlighted the broad coalition supporting plug-ins and demonstrated that the technology we need to electrify transportation is here today . <p> Jim Woolsey passionately argued that our dependence on oil is a national security emergency and that countries like Japan and Brazil have demonstrated the potential to overhaul an automotive fleet in a short period of time . Shai Agassi described Project Better Place and their plans to rapidly deploy electric vehicles in Israel . <p> Several speakers , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NRDC study on the impact of significant deployment of plug-in hybrids , including the finding that our current electric grid could power 73% of our vehicles if we charged them at night . Peter Darbee from PG&amp;E talked about how plug-in vehicles could work with smart electricity meters to increase the efficiency of the grid . <h> Tuesday 6/10/2008 08:17:00 PM <p> Posted by Michael Terrell , Program Manager , Google.org <p> A new survey commissioned by Google.org shows that three out of four voters support an active government role in promoting plug-in electric cars and trucks . The poll of more than 700 likely voters covered topics ranging from knowledge about plug-ins to opinions on how the government should promote them . <p> Plug-in electric vehicles run like regular hybrid cars , except they have larger batteries , recharge from a standard wall outlet , and can go more miles with less gas . Some plug-ins are purely electric and do n't  need gasoline at all . Given today 's record-high gas prices and concerns about energy security , plug-ins represent a promising solution for reducing oil dependence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Poll data showed a majority of voters said they would be more likely to vote for a candidate who supports federal efforts to bring plug-ins to the market , and more than 60 percent of voters are willing to spend more money to own a plug-in vehicle . <p> Over the next two days , Google.org and the Brookings Institution are hosting a conference in Washington , DC , " Plug-in Electric Vehicles 2008 : What Role for Washington ? " The conference will bring together Members of Congress , auto and utility executives , technologists , and plug-in advocates to spotlight plug-ins , examine their potential , and explore different federal policies to promote them .
