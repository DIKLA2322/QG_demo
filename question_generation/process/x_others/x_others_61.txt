@@13269101 @1869101/ <p> The finding indicates that West Virginia potentially holds the highest grade geothermal resources east of the Mississippi River . SMU estimates that 2% of West Virginia 's geothermal resources could support over 18,890 megawatts of electrical generating capacity using Enhanced Geothermal Systems ( EGS ) and other advanced geothermal technologies such as Co-Produced Fluids and Low Temperature Hydrothermal . <p> The SMU team has been developing entirely new pictures of the earth 's geothermal resources . They have started by aggregating thousands of new Bottom Hole Temperature ( BHT ) temperature readings from oil , gas , and water wells in previously under-sampled regions of the U.S. For example , The 2004 Geothermal Map of North America featured only four temperature points informing geothermal estimates for West Virginia , compared to 1,455 points in the updated version . In addition , the team has improved estimates of heat flow through the earth 's crust with better regional lithologic data . The new results indicate the potential for temperatures as high as 200c ( 392 f ) at depths of 5 kilometers ( 16,404 feet ) . <p> SMU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a new map and national resource estimatess . With improvements in EGS technology , these resources can be harnessed to provide clean , reliable , baseload renewable power 24/7/365 . <p> Our congratulations go out to the SMU team for their exiting discovery : Dr. David Blackwell , Maria Richards , Zachary Frone , and Joseph Batir . <p> For more information on Google.org 's geothermal investments and research projects , please visit google.org/egs.
@@13269103 @1869103/ <h> Innovation and Policy Enhance Each Other <p> Breakthroughs in clean energy technology can reduce the cost associated with implementing clean energy policies , effectively growing the economy while decarbonizing our energy use . Policies can also amplify the economic , security , and pollution benefits of breakthroughs by creating markets , disincentivizing the highest-emitting technologies , and leveling the playing field for clean energy , leading to increased adoption of clean energy . <p> We set very optimistic rates of innovation , pushing technologies hard on cost and performance . Even with aggressive breakthroughs , we achieved only a 49% reduction vs. 2005 emissions by 2050 in the All Tech Breakthrough scenario , well short of the standard , IPCC-inspired reduction targets of 80% by 2050 . <p> While our optimistic scenarios did not reach 80% , they did make substantial headway . Since innovations in biofuels , agricultural practices , or industrial energy efficiency were not modeled in detail , it is possible that a more comprehensive mix of energy innovation could achieve 80% reductions . <p> Reaching 80% reductions by 2050 will be difficult and likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have today . This analysis points to the need a multi-pronged strategy , combining both innovation and policy to mitigate climate change while growing the economy . <h> Coal is Very Hard to Displace on Economics Alone <p> Coal power is abundant and cheap in the United States , especially from older and fully depreciated plants . Major displacement of coal generation did not occur until clean energy became cheaper than the marginal cost of coal , which occurred predominately after 2030 even with clean power breakthroughs . <p> Post-2030 , breakthroughs in generation became cost advantaged vs. coal and start to pay off significantly . As clean power reached its lowest price points , displacement of coal accelerated rapidly from 2030 to 2050 . By 2050 , the All Tech Breakthrough scenario reduced coal 66% , and the $30/ton Carbon Price + Breakthrough scenario reduced coal use 87% vs . BAU .
@@13269104 @1869104/ <h> Tuesday 8/19/2008 07:26:00 AM <p> Today , as part of our Renewable Energy Cheaper than Coal initiative , Google.org announced more than $10 million in investments and grants in Enhanced Geothermal Systems ( EGS ) technology . EGS expands the potential of traditional geothermal energy by orders of magnitude . The traditional geothermal approach relies on finding naturally occurring pockets of steam or hot water . The EGS process , by comparison , replicates these conditions by fracturing hot rock , circulating water through the system , and using the resulting steam to produce electricity in a conventional turbine . <p> EGS has the potential to provide clean renewable electricity 24/7 , at a cost cheaper than coal . The ability to produce electricity from geothermal energy has been thought exclusive to locations such as California and Iceland . However EGS could allow us to harness the heat within the earth almost anywhere . To see see the massive size of the US geothermal resource accessible by EGS , check out our Google Earth layer . For more on EGS , watch this video , featuring Dr. Steve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dr. Jefferson Tester , professor of Chemical Engineering at MIT and lead author of a major recent study on EGS : <p> Working with Geodynamics , one of the world 's leading EGS development companies , we modeled Geodynamics ' first 50 MW system at the Cooper Basin in SketchUp , Google 's 3D modeling technology . To see how EGS works , check out the animation of the SketchUp model or download it . <p> EGS is heating up around the world . Australia , Germany , and the European Union are currently leading the technology and commercialization race . All 50 U.S. states , Europe , Russia , China , and India all have substantial thermal resources accessible by EGS . <p> While the US debates drilling in the ocean for oil , we are focused on drilling for renewable energy - and lots of it - right beneath our feet . A recent report by MIT on EGS estimated just 2% of the heat 3 - 10 km below below the continental United States is more than 2,500 times the country 's total annual energy use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help catch up to other nations , including expanded R&amp;D funding , a national renewable portfolio standard , and reliable tax incentives .
