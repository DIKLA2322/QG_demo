@@13269021 @1869021/ <h> Friday 4/02/2010 12:22:00 PM <p> The international community likes to define Liberias recent history primarily through two events : its fourteen-year civil war , which ended in 2003 , and the work of the countrys president , Ellen Johnson Sirleaf , the first democratically elected female leader in Africa . The chart below illustrates both . On my recent trip to Liberia , first with a group of Bay Area philanthropists hosted by the government and then as part of a small group of Googlers on a country visit , I learned more about how terrible the 1980s and 90s were in this small West African nation . GDP -- a crude measure of the health of a nation , but an indicator nonetheless -- dropped 90% as the country endured brutal dictatorship after brutal dictatorship . That decline is the largest in any nation since World War II , and nearly twice the percentage drop that Rwanda , Zimbabwe , and other states experienced during their crises . The good news is that although Liberia essentially had no economy at the depths of the war , GDP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and foreign direct investment has returned . <p> The numbers also tell a third story . Throughout the 1960s and 70s Liberias economy grew at a steady pace in a way that most other African economies did not . The growth was inequitable -- but real -- and the ingenuity and entrepreneurship that drove it are on full display today , albeit in ways that can sometimes puzzle a visitor to the country . <p> During the ten days I was in Liberia my colleagues and I always had a driver ; its the only way for foreigners to get around . The first day we reserved our car for 9:00am but when I looked out the hotel window at 9:02am I noticed the car speeding off with three other passengers . When I frantically called the driver he responded , " My man , do n't  worry -- I will get you to your meeting on time . " And he did . Then there was the night a local friend suggested dinner by saying , " Come on -- this place has a nice outdoor patio at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that did n't  quite sound as inviting as I meant it . " When we arrived our waiter was Frankie , a cheerful eight-year old sporting an Alex Rodriguez Yankees jersey who delivered our food and drink on the jog . At the local family restaurant , everyone pitched in . <p> Like most of Africa , cell phones are ubiquitous in Liberia and are the technology of choice for the vast majority of the population . Our meetings with the mobile providers there could have taken place anywhere in the world . They 're making money but are fiercely competitive with one another , slashing prices and offering new products to gain market share , and desperately trying to expand into new markets like broadband . Their activities are far from philanthropic , but they 're arguably having a more positive affect on Liberians day-to-day life than any other segment of society . The mobile penetration rate is 40% and rising , particularly in rural areas where phones are often the first " big " purchase a Liberian will make . <p> The countrys trademark ingenuity is of course noticeable here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different mobile carriers and switch back and forth depending on coverage and prices ( a noticeably nice option that 's not available in the locked-down U.S. market ) . Since unanswered calls do n't  incur a charge and the person who initiates the call pays more than the receiver , Liberians will also occasionally call and hang up , meaning , " I want talk to you but you can afford this more than I can , so call me back . " Scratch cards , which give you twenty or thirty minutes of talk time , are practically used as cash and are sold virtually everywhere . <p> The past thirty years have been difficult ones for most Liberians , and with an 80% unemployment rate and known war criminals still occupying high government offices , there are still huge problems to address . In the next two years the country will hold elections and most of the UN peacekeepers will withdraw . Watch closely : if both go well , a stable Liberia may finally be back .
