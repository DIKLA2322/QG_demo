@@13269042 @1869042/ <p> Each year we review our Google Flu Trends models and may update them , if an update would make them more accurate when compared with the official influenza data we benchmark against . In this paper , we , together with a member of the US CDC influenza division , provide details of how the original pre-H1N1 Google Flu Trends model for the US performed in comparison with the updated Google Flu Trends model when compared against the CDCs ILINet ( Influenza-Like-Illness ) data . <p> Since the original Google Flu Trends model for the US was built using only seasonal influenza data ( pandemic flu data did n't  exist in the five years prior to 2009 ) , we did not know how Google Flu Trends would perform during an outbreak of pandemic flu . If the symptoms and complications of pandemic flu were similar to seasonal flu , we expected Google Flu Trends would be able to detect it . <p> Time series plots of ILINet data and original and updated Google Flu Trends estimates <p> A. ILINet data and Google Flu Trends estimates from 2009 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire time period where GFT estimates are available : 2003-2009 . <p> ( Click on image to enlarge ) <p> We found that while both the original and updated Google Flu Trends models performed well prior to H1N1 , the updated model performed better during H1N1--particularly during the first wave of H1N1 . Though generally getting the trend correct , the original model underestimated the magnitude of ILI activity during the H1N1 . Why was this the case ? In short , search behavior changed during H1N1 . This was especially true for the categories " influenza complications " and " term for influenza . " This is not unexpected , since differing complications and the fact that H1N1 began spreading during the northern hemisphere summer rather than winter likely played a role . It is interesting to see how the categories and examples of specific queries changed , though . For some specific examples , read the paper . <p> Were soon headed into flu season for the half of the world in the Northern hemisphere , so let 's stay healthy !
