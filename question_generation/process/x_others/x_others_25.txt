@@13268960 @1868960/ <h> Tuesday 7/03/2012 05:09:00 PM <p> As we 've seen in the last decade , information technology can save lives in a crisis . But even as data becomes more crucial to rescue efforts , key information like evacuation routes , shelter locations and weather alerts often remains inaccessible to the public . Time is of the essence in the wake of a disaster , and it 's critical for emergency information to be available in open standards and formats to enable instant communication among first responders and affected populations . <p> This was the theme of our first Big Tent in Asia , held yesterday in Sendai , Japan . The event brought together tech industry leaders , non-profits , volunteers and government officials to discuss how technology can better assist in preparing for , responding to and rebuilding from disasters . This is an extremely pertinent issue for the Asia-Pacific region , as nearly 70 percent of fatalities from natural disasters occur here . And with the earthquake and tsunami last year affecting the coastal regions of Northeastern Japan , Sendai was a particularly meaningful location to discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reduce the impact and cost of disasters . <p> During the panels , the audience heard stories about how two Pakistani volunteers mapped their home country so well through Google MapMaker that the UNs mapping agency UNOSAT adopted the maps and provided them to aid workers during the Pakistan floods . Sam Johnson , Founder of the Christchurch Student Army and Young New Zealander of the Year , talked about using Facebook to quickly coordinate relief efforts on the ground after the earthquakes in Christchurch in 2010 and 2011 . Twitter Japan Country Manager James Kondo talked about Japanese earthquake victims tweeting with the hashtag " stranded " in order to find help . Meanwhile representatives of open source project Ushahidi talked of " brainsourcing " reporters on the ground and remote volunteers to keep the world abreast of conditions in disasters such as the earthquake in Chile in 2010 . <p> After the panels , conversations and debates , four key themes emerged . First , there is a conflict between traditional closed data architectures and emerging open modelsand we need to close the gap between them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both authoritative data from official sources and crowdsourced data . Third , there 's a universal need for data , but they way its shared needs to be tailored to the local environmentfor example , Internet-reliant countries vs . SMS-reliant countries . Finally , we were reminded that beyond the data itself , communication and collaboration are key in a crisis . Information is n't worth anything unless people are taking that information , adapting it , consulting it and getting it to the people who need it . <p> One of the panels at Big Tent Sendai <p> Crisis response tools will continue to improve and more people across the globe will own devices to quickly access the information they need . But there are still major challenges we must address . As Margareta Wahlstr+m , UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction said , we can now get quick warnings and alerts to many populations on their phones , but many who receive the alerts do n't  know how to act . <p> To see clips from Sendai and previous events , visit the Big Tent YouTube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ via comments , get more information on the presenters and see how different communities approach many of the same issues .

@@13268962 @1868962/ <h> Thursday 12/10/2009 04:59:00 AM <p> Today , at the International Climate Change Conference ( COP15 ) in Copenhagen , we demonstrated a new technology prototype that enables online , global-scale observation and measurement of changes in the earth 's forests . We hope this technology will help stop the destruction of the world 's rapidly-disappearing forests . Emissions from tropical deforestation are comparable to the emissions of all of the European Union , and are greater than those of all cars , trucks , planes , ships and trains worldwide . According to the Stern Review , protecting the world 's standing forests is a highly cost-effective way to cut carbon emissions and mitigate climate change . The United Nations has proposed a framework known as REDD ( Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries ) that would provide financial incentives to rainforest nations to protect their forests , in an effort to make forests worth " more alive than dead . " Implementing a global REDD system will require that each nation have the ability to accurately monitor and report the state of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verifiable . However , many of these tropical nations of the world lack the technological resources to do this , so we 're working with scientists , governments and non-profits to change this . Here 's what we 've done with this prototype to help nations monitor their forests : <p> Start with satellite imagerySatellite imagery data can provide the foundation for measurement and monitoring of the world 's forests . For example , in Google Earth today , you can fly to Rondonia , Brazil and easily observe the advancement of deforestation over time , from 1975 to 2001 : <p> ( Landsat images courtesy USGS ) <p> This type of imagery data past , present and future is available all over the globe . Even so , while today you can view deforestation in Google Earth , until now there has n't been a way to measure it . <p> Then add scienceWith this technology , it 's now possible for scientists to analyze raw satellite imagery data and extract meaningful information about the world 's forests , such as locations and measurements of deforestation or even regeneration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've collaborated with Greg Asner of Carnegie Institution for Science , and Carlos Souza of Imazon . Greg and Carlos are both at the cutting edge of forest science and have developed software that creates forest cover and deforestation maps from satellite imagery . Organizations across Latin America use Greg 's program , Carnegie Landsat Analysis System ( CLASlite ) , and Carlos ' program , Sistema de Alerta de Deforestation ( SAD ) , to analyze forest cover change . However , widespread use of this analysis has been hampered by lack of access to satellite imagery data and computational resources for processing . <p> Handle computation in the cloudWhat if we could offer scientists and tropical nations access to a high-performance satellite imagery-processing engine running online , in the " Google cloud " ? And what if we could gather together all of the earths raw satellite imagery data petabytes of historical , present and future data and make it easily available on this platform ? We decided to find out , by working with Greg and Carlos to re-implement their software online , on top of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to terabytes of satellite imagery and thousands of computers in our data centers . <p> Here are the results of running CLASlite on the satellite imagery sequence shown above : <p> CLASlite online - This shows deforestation and degradation in Rondonia , Brazil from 1986-2008 , with the red indicating recent activity <p> Here 's the result of running SAD in a region of recent deforestation pressure in Mato Grosso , Brazil : <p> SAD online - The red " hotspots " indicate deforestation that has happened within the last 30 days <p> Combining science with massive data and technology resources in this way offers the following advantages : <p> Unprecedented speed : On a top-of-the-line desktop computer , it can take days or weeks to analyze deforestation over the Amazon . Using our cloud-based computing power , we can reduce that time to seconds . Being able to detect illegal logging activities faster can help support local law enforcement and prevent further deforestation from happening . <p> Ease of use and lower costs : An online platform that offers easy access to data , scientific algorithms and computation horsepower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complexity for tropical nations to monitor their forests . <p> Security , privacy and transparency : Governments and researchers do n't want to share sensitive data and results before they are ready . Our cloud-based platform allows users to control access to their data and results . At the same time , because the data , analysis and results reside online , they can also be easily shared , made available for collaboration , presented to the public and independently verified when appropriate . <p> Climate change impact : We think that a suitably scaled-up and enhanced version of this platform could be a promising as a tool for forest monitoring , reporting and verification ( MRV ) in support of efforts such as REDD . <p> As a Google.org product , this technology will be provided to the world as a not-for-profit service . This technology prototype is currently available to a small set of partners for testing purposes it 's not yet available to the general public but we expect to make it more broadly available over the next year . We are grateful to a host of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have advised us on developing this technology . In particular , we would like to thank the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation for their close partnership since the initial inception of this project . The goal of the Moore Foundations Environmental Conservation Program is to change the ways in which people use important terrestrial and coastal marine ecosystems to conserve critical ecological systems and functions , while allowing sustainable use . We 're also working with the Group on Earth Observations ( GEO ) , a consortium of national government bodies , inter-governmental organizations , space agencies and research institutions through GEO 's Forest Carbon Tracking ( FCT ) task force . Last month together we launched the GEO FCT portal and are now exploring how we can also together bring the power of this new technology to tropical nations . <p> We 're excited to be able to share this early prototype and look forward to seeing what 's possible .

This was the second in a series of mapping events intended to encourage local people to create accurate and detailed maps of South Sudan , to help them navigate their path to independence . There were over 100 attendees in the room , mostly Sudanese -- university students , humanitarian workers , journalists , developers , donors , citizens -- coming from Nairobi and its surroundings , but also as far as Juba , the capital of South Sudan . <p> The lives of the South Sudanese are anchored to their history and land . The event started with the sharing of prayers , stories and songs , allowing each of us to visualize the rivers , sheep , roads , and people . Drawn from these songs , the mapping of South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see schools , roads , rivers , historical monuments , and cemeteries being mapped over cities such as Aweil , Boma , Bor , Malakal , Rumbek , Tonga , Torit , and more . <p> Community Mapping Event in Nairobi on June 30 , 2011 <p> Many were interested in health resource mapping which can dramatically impact the lives of their new countrymen . Every year in South Sudan about one in every seven children dies before the age of five ; the maternity mortality rate is one of the highest in the world , and only 30% of the population has access to health care . For Charles Mona , Director GIS , Remote Sensing &amp; Cartography of the South Sudan Government , quality health resource maps would be great tools for improved health care planning , resource allocation , advocacy , and also increased access to health services for the local population . This is only one example of how accurate maps can help various organizations provide better services to the the South Sudanese . <p> Happy independence day to the South Sudanese ! Together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email discussions . The next Community Mapping event will be in Juba , so stay tuned for more details .
