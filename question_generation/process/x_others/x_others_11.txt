We want to encourage others in the energy monitoring space to do the same . To this end , I 'd like to introduce our most recent strategic partner Microchip , which is a supplier of cost-effective , innovative products for the embedded developer . Today , Microchip will include as part of their developer demonstration environment the Google PowerMeter API library that we recently announced . This integration will make it much easier to create devices compatible with Google PowerMeter which means one can more quickly go from concept to demo to product . <p> The Google PowerMeter API is designed to work with a variety of energy monitoring devices - from utilities with smart meters , back haul networks and enterprise scale meter data management systems - to small embedded consumer devices that can send energy information directly to Google PowerMeter . <p> Google 's belief in open source also means that the Google PowerMeter API library is available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tinkerers and makers are welcome to explore the code and use it in their products . <p> As we search for clean energy alternatives , it is important that everyone - from utilities to garage inventors - get a chance to try out new technologies and methods so that we all benefit from their inspirations.

More than 70 members of the Sudanese diaspora , along with regional experts from the World Bank , Sudan Institute , Voices for Sudan , The Enough Project and other organizations gathered together to map what is expected to become the worlds newest country later this year : the Republic of South Sudan . UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has asked the international community " to assist all Sudanese towards greater stability and development " during and beyond this period of transition . <p> South Sudan is a large but under-mapped region , and there are very few high-quality maps that display essential features like roads , hospitals and schools . Up-to-date maps are particularly important to humanitarian aid groups , as they help responders target their efforts and mobilize their resources of equipment , personnel and supplies . More generally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructure and economy of the country and region . <p> The Map Maker communitya wide-ranging group of volunteers that help build more comprehensive maps of the world using our online mapping tool , Google Map Makerhas been contributing to the mapping effort for Sudan since the referendum on January 9 . To aid their work , we 've published updated satellite imagery of the region , covering 125,000 square kilometers and 40 percent of the U.N.s priority areas , to Google Earth and Maps . <p> The goal of last weeks event was to engage and train members of the Sudanese diaspora in the United States , and others who have lived and worked in the region , to use Google Map Maker so they could contribute their local knowledge of the region to the ongoing mapping effort , particularly in the area of social infrastructure . Our hope is that this event and others like it will help build a self-sufficient mapping community that will contribute their local expertise and remain engaged in Sudan over time . <p> We were inspired by the groups enthusiasm . One attendee told us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that before today did not exist on any maps that I know of ... a place unknown to the world . Now I can show to my kids , my friends , my community , where I used to live and better tell the story of my people . " <p> The group worked together to make several hundred edits to the map of Sudan in four hours . As those edits are approved , theyll appear live in Google Maps , available for all the world to see . But this wasnt just a one-day undertakingattendees will now return to their home communities armed with new tools and ready to teach their friends and family how to join the effort . We look forward to seeing the Southern Sudanese mapping community grow and flourish .

A team from the GDG Karachi Extended event in Pakistan developed a concept for Green It a Google+ based app that would allow users to report local environmental concerns , gain validation of the issue via nearby smartphone users and aggregate reports in a public online interface . Users would be encouraged to participate through a rewards system . <p> Google Ideas - Conflict reporting for blackout situations in repressive regimes A team from the San Francisco Extended event developed a product concept for Silent Lens ; an Android application which would allow citizens to safely send encrypted image-based messages over multi-modal ad-hoc mesh networks . The app would allow citizens to anonymously report issues or violence in repressive regimes when other phone or Internet connections may be temporarily limited , or intermittently severed . <p> Google Politics &amp; Elections - Citizen Engagement for Politics &amp; Elections A team from the Lagos GDGI/O Extended event at the Co Creation Hub in Nigeria built a prototype for Assembly Bills a web based platform that can help Nigerian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without having to fly across the country to the capital of Lagos to provide input in person , as is currently necessary .

Congratulations to the winners , and a huge thanks to all participants for their hard work . We look forward to seeing the winning teams build out their ideas !
