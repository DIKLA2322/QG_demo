He delivered a powerful talk that highlighted the risk of a devastating future pandemic , and described one of his big ideas for combating the threat . His mantra of ' Early Detection , Early Response ' inspired other groups such as InSTEDD , who recently launched a suite of open-source applications to allow collaboration between first responders during disease outbreaks and disasters , and the team behind Google Flu Trends . <p> Now , this important theme has been revisited at TED by Dr. Nathan Wolfe , founder of the Global Viral Forecasting Initiative ( GVFI ) , a new non-profit funded by Google.org and the Skoll Foundation . Dr Wolfe 's rousing message is that when it comes to pandemics , early detection in humans is n't early enough . We know that 75% of new human diseases begin in animals so to discover a pandemic before it devastates the human population , we need to catch new viruses when they take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This mission has taken the GVFI team into some remote and difficult locations , from the jungles of Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of Congo ( profiled on CNN 's Planet in Peril ) , to the wet markets of China and Malaysia . Here , they collect blood samples from animals and the humans with whom they 're in contact , in order to analyse them for evidence of early viral crossover . <p> You can hear more about this important work and some of GVFI 's exciting viral discoveries by watching Dr Wolfe 's talk at TED . Pass this on , and help spread ideas , not diseases ! <h> Monday 3/16/2009 05:51:00 PM <p> An interesting article making a case for the use of online information for earlier detection of disease outbreaks came out last week in the Canadian Medical Association Journal . The article , co-authored by HealthMap co-founder and Google.org grantee John Brownstein , looks at an outbreak of listeriosis in Canada and compares online search trends , news reports , and diagnosed case counts during the outbreak period . <p> Listeriosis is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Canada killed about 20 people last summer . By using Google Insights for Search data combined with HealthMap 's news surveillance data , the authors discovered that a specific search query provided even earlier indication of the outbreak than news reports . <p> So , what was that key search term that gave the earliest indication of the outbreak ? Listeriosis . That 's right , when the researchers looked at trends for people searching online for the technical term " Listeriosis , " they discovered that the peak of the search trend for that term was the same as the actual peak of medically diagnosed Listeriosis cases . The increase in online searches for " Listeriosis " began in mid-July , one month before the federal announcement that an outbreak was underway in Canada . This means that people diagnosed with Listeriosis , or others close to them , were likely to be the ones searching for that term online at the time of diagnosis , causing a spike . <p> In contrast , search trends for " Listeria , " the term used in the public announcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcement and other news reports in mid-August . Thus , people searching for " Listeria " were probably doing so in response to the press about the outbreak , not because they 'd been diagnosed . <p> Early detection is critical to helping health officials respond more quickly . While documenting the potential for using online info for earlier outbreak detection , the authors also recognize the challenges . This seems to be the tip of the iceberg for research in this area , and it has others talking too - check out the Wall Street Journal blog which calls this " a wonkier example of Google Flu Trends . " <p> The U.S. solar industry is expected to support more than 440,000 permanent , full-time jobs , including many in the manufacturing and construction industry , by the year 2016 . The solar jobs growth layer shows where these jobs are likely to be created across the country . You 'll see that many of these jobs are being created in states that have experienced the worst of the current economic crisis , including Pennsylvania , Michigan , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state shows annual job growth over an eight year period , as well as how the three most common solar **25;289;TOOLONG , concentrating solar power , and solar water heatingstack-up in terms of job creation . <p> In addition to exploring the job growth numbers , you can view a 3-D simulation of the job growth over time and compare the solar energy resources of each state with their job growth potential . In the additional data , you can also see solar installations , like photovoltaic panels and solar water heating at the Georgia Tech Aquatic Center in Atlanta and a solar power tower at the Solar Energy Generating Systems ( SEGS ) in Southern California , to see what they actually look like in Google Earth . <p> Because predicting job creation in the future relies on advanced economic modeling , it can be difficult to predict where all the solar jobs will be created . Nearly 30,000 jobs will likely be created across the other 29 states that are n't  explicitly covered in this map . That means solar energy truly is capable of creating a green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as part of SEREFs and Google.orgs shared objective to rapidly scale-up the use of solar technologies in the U.S. so that the environmental , economic , and national security benefits of renewables can be realized .
