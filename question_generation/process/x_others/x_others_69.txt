Seriously - you can spend a full year living and working at the nexus of development and enterprise ! Of course , there 's an application and an interview process , and Acumen Fund is looking for a specific kind of person - someone with " the moral imagination , the practical skills and the leadership potential to effect real change , " as Acumen Fund 's Deepti Doshi put it on the Acumen Fund blog . <p> If you are interested in the base of the pyramid sector and believe you have the skills and experience to contribute to this mission over the next year , please apply . If you 're happy doing what you 're doing , fantastic . But I 'm sure you know a few people for whom the fellowship is indeed a dream . Please send them our way .
