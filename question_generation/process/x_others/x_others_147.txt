Using untapped spectrum can help improve broadband access in many parts of the worldas its doing in our trial in South Africaand spark new innovation in wireless technology . <p> In March , we shared an update on our efforts to become a certified database administrator for a band of spectrum called the TV white spaces . Today , our database received final certification from the FCC.This is an exciting step forward . With FCC certification , we can do more to help make spectrum available . We are ready to work with leaders in the wireless industrythose developing certified devices that can talk to a databaseto help them gain access to TV White spaces spectrum to help bring new technologies and services to market . Our database has already helped to show that there is available spectrum out there--if you know where to look . For example , we used the database to help visualize available spectrum in Cape Town , South Africa and Dakar , Senegal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , multiple users can share spectrum , accessing what they they need when they need it , and allowing others to use it when they do n't  . With more unused spectrum being put to good use , we hope to see more wireless innovation and wireless broadband access for users.Posted by Alan Norman , Principal , Access <p> This embeddable map shows evacuation zones , emergency shelter locations , public alerts , traffic conditions , and more . With help from the City of Calgary , Province of Alberta , CBC News and several local communities , the map uses open data to provide important information for people in affected areas . <p> We created the Google Crisis Map to help people find and use critical emergency information when they need it most . <p> See below for more information on embedding this map for your use , and keep an eye on the crisis map as we continue to add new information . <p> Our thoughts remain with everyone in Alberta affected by these floods , and with the many officials and first responders throughout the province whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort . <h> Tuesday 6/04/2013 05:37:00 PM <p> Cross-posted from the Google Developers BlogOn June 1st and 2nd , thousands of developers from across the U.S. came together at nearly 100 different locations to participate in the first ever National Day of Civic Hacking . Usingpublic datarecently released by the government on topics like crime , health and the environment , developers built new applications that help address social challenges.At the Googleplex in Mountain View , we hosted nearly 100 developers , statisticians , data scientists , and designers , who stayed long into the night hacking together prototypes that show how data on health and the environment can be used to enrich lives . Fusion TablesandGoogle App Enginewere used to prototype , and groups relied onBigQueryas a workhorse to crunch the biggest datasets . Participants used Google+ Hangouts to connect with hackathons in other states and collaborated with Google Apps and platforms.Here are a few highlights from the hackathon that stood out as useful , visually stunning , and informative ways to use public data : <p> Eat Healthy for Less , the winner of our Mountain View hackathon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pricing Index to suggest healthy recipes that can be made on a budget . <p> Data+ , a reimagining of how we access data , can make exploring public datasets more intuitive and easily understandable for everyone . <p> Detoxic.org is a web experience and Android app that shows you toxic sites and landfills nearby that you might not know about so that you can take civic action against toxic waste . <p> Many of the ideas have great potential , and we are encouraging participants to continue their work . We hope that the National Day of Civic Hacking will be a catalyst for innovation in this space , and encourage you to keep track of our tools for civic developers at g.co/civicdevelopers . <h> Monday 6/03/2013 06:21:00 PM <p> To help bring more of Africa online , we often work with others : offering programs to get universities connected , supporting nonprofit innovators to increase engineering know-how , and partnering to test the use of TV White Spaces for broadband access in underserved areas . TV White Spaces--unused channels in the broadcast TV spectrum--have the potential to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile , or final connection to the user , is one of the biggest challenges to improving connectivity in Sub-Saharan Africa and other emerging markets . TV White Spaces are important because they offer available and underutilized spectrum ( especially in less developed areas ) , allow signals to travel over long distances , and can enable a lower-cost alternative for broadband . <p> TV White Spaces are available . Using our spectrum database , we shared a visual of available white space in Senegal . There is more than 90 MHz available in Dakar alone , and more across the country--spectrum that could be used for broadband . Compared to the San Francisco Bay area , the number of available channels is remarkable . <p> Regulation can pave a path in African markets . ICASA , the South African regulator , plans to use trial outcomes to evaluate possible rules for use of the TV White Spaces . Other regulators showing interest in TV White Spaces for broadband included Senegal , as well as Malawi , where less than 9% of the population receives broadcast TV and many channels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White Spaces . Radio manufacturers shared how TV White Spaces radios can talk to a database , which tells the radio which channels are available in a given geography . Adaptrum and Carlson presented the results of deployments of these radios , in Kenya and South Africa respectively . <p> From trials to databases to radios , these efforts show that players are stepping up to use TV White Spaces to help enable Internet access in West Africa and beyond . That 's good news for a future where more people have access to the Web .
