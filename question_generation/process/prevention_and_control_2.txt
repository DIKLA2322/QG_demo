Preface
Since December 2019, several cases of novel infectious diseases caused by novel coronavirus infection with predominantly pulmonary lesions have been detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province. As the outbreak spreads, such cases have been identified in other regions of China and outside China. The clinical features of this viral infection are fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, generally low or decreased peripheral blood leukocytes, and inflammatory changes on chest radiographs. The World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed and named its pathogen as COVID-19, a novel coronavirus belonging to the genus Î². It was designated as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 31, 2020.
