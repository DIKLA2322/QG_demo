5. Chest imaging showed significant progression of the lung lesion.
(ii) Children.
1. Increased respiratory rate.
2. poor mental responsiveness and drowsiness.
3. Progressive elevation of lactic acid.
4. Significant elevation of inflammatory factors such as CRP, PCT and ferritin.
5. imaging showing bilateral or multilobar infiltrates, pleural effusions or rapid progression of lesions in a short period of time.
6. have underlying diseases (congenital heart disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, respiratory malformations, abnormal hemoglobin, severe malnutrition, etc.), immune deficiency or hypo-immunity (long-term use of immunosuppressive drugs) and neonates.
IX. Differential diagnosis
(a) The mild manifestations of novel coronavirus pneumonia need to be differentiated from upper respiratory tract infections caused by other viruses.
(b) Novel coronavirus pneumonia is mainly distinguished from other known viral pneumonia such as influenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection, especially in suspected cases, rapid antigen detection, multiplex PCR nucleic acid detection and other methods to detect common respiratory pathogens.
