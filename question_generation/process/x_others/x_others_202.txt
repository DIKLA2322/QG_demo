@@13269123 @1869123/ <h> Wednesday 8/10/2011 11:30:00 AM <p> Pakistan continues on a trajectory of exciting technology initiatives , sparked most recently by three consecutive Google Map Maker events in Karachi , Islamabad and Lahore in early June . Following on the heels of these successful MapUps , P@SHA ( Pakistan Software Houses Association for IT &amp; ITES ) , in collaboration with Google , launched a fund to drive social innovation in Pakistan . <p> The purpose of the P@SHA Social Innovation fund is to encourage big ideas by providing the Pakistani people with financial support and guidance for social innovation projects . Google has provided a seed grant of US$250,000 , which will be allocated to 25 all-star proposals that incorporate technology as a means of addressing a specific social need , such as flood relief or disease prevention . The idea is not simply to fund the creation of software , but to fund ideas that use Information and Communication Technologies as a platform for delivery and as a means for empowerment . <p> In addition to offering funding , P@SHA has established an oversight committee , advisory board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide the shortlisted proposals from inception to reality . The hope is to create a safe harbor for eager entrepreneurs to jump-start ideas without the fear of failure . P@SHA President Jehan Ara anticipates that many of these ideas will emerge from Pakistani youth . According to Jehan , one of Pakistans main strengths is that 60% of the population is below the age of 24 , something the country can leverage . Jehan believes a large number of these individuals are passionate about making a difference in the communities in which they live--and , to some extent , are already doing so . <p> Google Map Maker has already witnessed several such innovations in Pakistan , such as Sindh Flood Maps , FloodMAPS of Dr. Sohaib Khan , and http : //www.local.com.pk/ , which implement the Google Maps API to assist in disaster relief management . Proposals are being accepted through August , and are not limited by age , gender , caste or creed . P@SHA requires only that applicants be Pakistanis who are based in Pakistan and ready to share their innovations with the world . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that may be in store following P@SHAs announcement of winners in the early fall , and encourage all our avid Pakistani mappers and brilliant innovators to submit their big idea !
