@@13269044 @1869044/ <h> Friday 1/28/2011 07:26:00 PM <p> Google.org continues to ramp up technology projects and test new ideas while Googles overall charitable giving , in-kind giving and employee volunteering have grown as well . Our newsletter outlines the latest updates to our philanthropic projects . I caught up with Megan Smith , VP New Business Development and General Manager of Google.org , to talk about how Google views philanthropy . <p> After two years at the helm of Google.org , what are you most optimistic about ? The Internet offers an opportunity to connect in ways never before possible . Things that have historically been far apart are now " virtually adjacent " most people are a text away , data sets can be mashed up , and all world knowledge is coming online from both expected and surprising sources . Given all of this , I am most excited about all the extraordinary ways people are using the web to connect , be informed , use data and to start solving problems together . <p> For Google.org specifically , we want to contribute our knowledge and skills to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have more than 50 engineers and about 40 other cross-functional Googlers working on four or five larger projectslike Google Crisis Response and RE&lt;Cand over a dozen smaller experimental pilot projects . <p> What kind of project fits this opportunity ? One of our newer projects , Google Earth Engine , takes advantage of Googles computing infrastructure to create a planetary sciences computation platform that could help reduce negative environmental impact at scale . The first focus is on deforestation monitoring . Earth Engine has just made it through the pilot phase to a full project with its launch last month at climate change talks in Mexico . If we meet our goals to enable global-scale monitoring of changes in the planets environment , I believe that Earth Engine could play an important information role in helping to slow deforestation . <p> What 's the biggest lesson you 've learned since joining Google.org ? Two things : first , the opportunity we have is great ; and second , the work has served as a reminder that creating truly useful , innovative technology is challenging and requires patient iteration , dialog , teamwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , learn from the right partners , collaborate , pilot those ideas that pass initial assessment and then launch for scale the few projects that meet the criteria for a Google.org product . <p> Do Google.org projects have a specific focus ? We do n't  have a topical focuswe work on technology solutions to many different kinds of global challenges . The key is to take advantage of Googles strengths . In the area of global health , for example , we have been able to create a global flu monitoring system based on search data . For our environmental work , we were able to leverage our data center computing power to put together the finest-scale forest map of Mexico to date ( processing this data would take two years on one computer , but we made it in less than 24 hours using our computing infrastructure ) . <p> How does Google.org start and ramp up its technology projects ? We work to tap into the talent at Google . Some projects have come out of hallway conversations and others from extensive talks with partners in the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with senior engineers where talented individuals or teams within Google bring ideas or prototypes . If we think the idea is a match and has promise , we give it budget , headcount , guidance and time to see where it can go during a pilot period . Once we have a live pilot or project , we take advantage of Google.coms standard project review and management processes that our company has effectively used for years . <p> What if those pilots fail ? That 's normal . We should expect that some of them will fail or will only have smaller impact . If you 're not failing some of the time , you 're not taking risks . As we progress , some of our failures will hopefully teach us as much as some of our successes . <p> What other charitable giving does Google do ? As a company that has been doing well , its important that we push ourselves to be amongst the most generous companies . We have several charitable giving programs supporting , for example , education ( especially K-12 science and math programs ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solutions for underserved groups . Last year the company gave more than $145 million to non-profits and academic institutions , and more than $184 million when including Google Grants , Google.org technology projects and in-kind product support for non-profits . <p> How is this philanthropic work different from that of other companies ? Like other companies , we have charitable giving programs , we provide products in-kind and we have a range of employee volunteering programs . Some companies like ours may also have experiments like Google.org to leverage their strengthsa form of skills-based giving . However , many companies do amazing charitable work through a centralized Corporate Social Responsibility arm that tackles a key issue or two . We approach philanthropy the way we do our core business , with big goals and a " launch early and iterate " approach . Ideas come from all over the company and we work to tackle a range of issues we care about , from clean energy to education to development . It may not be as clean as the process that some others have , but we think this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain determined , as our founders said when they set the vision for Google.org , " to find original ways to extend our assets , so that we can drive scalable , sustainable efforts . ... the underlying principle : Never stop looking for ways to do the best with what you have . " <p> Currently , for every well that sends cold water down to the hot rock ( called injectors ) , there are one to three wells that bring heated water back up to generate electricity ( called producers ) . But what if one well could act as both an injector and producer ? It could dramatically lower the cost of EGS ( example below ) . The Stanford team , which included graduate students Zhe Wang and Mark McClure , modeled a variety of single-well configurations to determine their feasibility . The investigation determined that on a per well basis , an optimal single-well EGS system would produce four times more energy than an isolated pair of wells and two times more energy than an infinite series of alternating producers and injectors . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , present another innovative technique for advancing baseload EGS on the path to RE&lt;C . <p> On a trip to Jerusalem three years ago , Jonathan Rosenbergvisited Yad Vashem . Struck by the museum 's vast historical record housed within the physical building , he hoped Google could do something powerful to showcase this information . Inspired by the challenge , a few of us , in our " 20% time , " started working with Yad Vashem and eventually grew our effort into a full project , introducing a YouTube channel in 2008 and now this collections site . <p> Within the archive you will find more than 130,000 images in full resolution . You can search for them via a custom search engine on Yad Vashems collections site . And by using experimental optical character recognition ( OCR ) , we 've transcribed the text on many images , making them even more discoverable on the web . This means that if you search for the name of a family member who was in the Holocaust , you might find a link to an image on the Yad Vashem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , try searching for the term rena weiser , the name of a Jewish refugee . You 'll find a link to a visa issued to her by the Consulate of Chile in France . OCR technology made this picture discoverable to those searching for her . <p> Yad Vashem encourages you to add personal stories about images that have meaning for you in the " share your thoughts " section below each item . Doron Avni , a fellow Googler , has already added a story . He found a photograph of his grandfather taken immediately after his release from a Nazi prison . His grandfather had vowed that if he should survive , he would immediately have his picture taken to preserve the memory of his experience in the Holocaust . He stitched the photo into his coat , an act that later saved his life . After hiding in the forest for a year , Russian soldiers mistook him for a German enemy , but released him once they saw this picture . <p> Dorons grandfather <p> The Yad Vashem partnership is part of our larger effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in similar projects in the past including digitizing major libraries in Europe , collections at the Prado Museum in Madrid , and the LIFE photo archive . We encourage organizations interested in partnering with us in our archiving efforts to enter their information in this form . <p> Were proud to be launching this significant archive that will allow people to discover images that are part of their heritage , and will aid people worldwide researching the Holocaust . <h> Friday 1/21/2011 03:00:00 PM <p> How can students hone their marketing skills and help an NGO at the same time ?

Thank you for your support ! <h> Wednesday 1/12/2011 09:50:00 AM <p> Its been one year since the 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck Haiti , and governments and NGOs are continuing to respond , many using high-resolution images of the area . To support these efforts , we 've updated our aerial imagery in Google Earth of the Port-au-Prince area to include images from before and after the earthquake , as well as made updates throughout 2010 . These pictures provide an evolving view of the movement of people , supplies and rubble . <p> Complementing our online efforts with this imagery , a webpage and crisis response tools such as Person Finder , Google has made an effort to contribute to relief in Haiti by providing technical and financial support to NGOs . These organizations such as Doctors Without Borders and Partners in Health and specific technology NGOs such as Samasource and Frontline SMS continue to help the Haitian people . Weve looked to them to help us guide our ongoing response to this crisis . <p> In November , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave of Google teams to Haiti to evaluate our earlier response efforts and see where Google could continue to provide help . We met with local Haitians and technology NGOs under tents , in trailers , in Internet cafes and at restaurants . <p> From these visits we witnessed the difficulty involved in using our mapping tools under the unpredictable nature of the Internet in Haiti , and so have focused on developing better offline capabilities and have proposed ideas for improving overall Internet access in Haiti . We also ran training for aid workers on our collaborative tools like Google Apps , which can help coordinate resources . While there , we spent time understanding how NGOs are combating the cholera epidemic , and brainstorming tools that could help aid workers produce specialized maps of epidemic case data and chlorination levels at water points , which are critical for planning and prevention . <p> If you 're interested in helping with Googles efforts in Haiti , you can : <p> Our experience and the updated imagery demonstrate that there are still significant needs on the ground in Haiti . Were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward to seeing how technology will continue to help both Haitians and victims of disasters worldwide . <h> 1/12/2011 08:26:00 AM <p> Weve been working over the last 24 hours to access the latest information from authorities about river levels and projected road closures due to flooding and to display the information on a Google Map . You can view the map here to see layers of information including which roads are projected to be closed or river levels in a particular area . <p> We hope this map is of some use to people who may be affected and that it takes the load off some other websites that are coping with lots of queries . We will let you know of any additional updates on this blog . <p> If your personal safety is impacted by floods , please visit the official sites : <p> For eligible charities working directly on flood assistance , we have made available additional emergency funding through our Google Grants program . More information for charities not currently participating in the program is available here . <p> Our thoughts are with everyone affected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those from around the country for the work of emergency services personnel and SES volunteers . <p> Posted by Anthony Baxter and James McGill , Software Engineers ( on behalf of the team of willing Googlers who helped out on this ) <h> Friday 1/07/2011 05:29:00 PM <p> Sudan is preparing to vote on January 9 to decide if the South will become independent from the North . The referendum is part of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed in 2005 ending the Civil War , which lasted 22 years and led to the deaths of an estimated 2 million people . Analysts fear the possibility of renewed violence . <p> Sudan is a huge country ( 2.5 million km2 ) , with an estimated population of 44 million people , but its poorly mapped . Without basic geospatial information , its difficult for humanitarian agencies and first responders to monitor and evaluate the risks and current needs , target their efforts , and mobilize proper resources . At times like these , it is critical to have good maps on roads , settlements , voting stations , hospitals , buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - to generate better , faster responses . <p> If you have knowledge of Southern Sudan , an interest in mapping , and some free time , we encourage you to join the effort . With tools such as Google Map Maker and Sudan Vote Monitor , you have the opportunity to take concrete action by improving the map , helping to monitor and report human rights violations in near-real time and providing insight into the socio-political climate prevalent in the country and region . <p> Global Call for Action:Together let 's build a better map of Southern Sudan . Your local knowledge and mapping contributions of schools , hospitals , and landmarks will be extremely useful to the humanitarian community to quickly build a picture of the situation , especially in these areas of interest . <p> Items that you can map : <p> Towns and town names ( Arabic and local names especially ) <p> Roads ( in-town roads as well ) and trails <p> Displaced persons camps <p> Cultural landmarks <p> Geographic landmarks <p> Schools <p> Orphanages , shelters etc . <p> Hospitals <p> Community centers <p> Border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathering points <p> This is an opportunity to utilize the power of community engagement through mapping . We welcome you to get acclimated to Map Maker through our Getting Started page , and then invite you to join our Sudan-specific discussions .
