@@13268996 @1868996/ <h> Monday 11/19/2012 02:53:00 PM <p> Inspiration comes in many shapes and forms . For U.S. Marine Sgt. Winston Fiore , it was a news article about the International Childrens Surgical Foundation ( ICSF ) and Dr. Geoff Williams , who provides free facial-reconstructive surgeries for children with cleft lips/palates in developing countries . Although cleft palates are quite correctable , if left untreated the deformity can cause serious health issues . Many children do n't  have the surgery because the cost of each procedure ( $250 USD ) is out of reach for their families . <p> Inspired to do something to help , Winston set out on a 5,000-mile trek across Southeast Asia to raise money and awareness for the ICSFa mission he dubbed Smile Trek . Armed with sturdy boots , a 20-pound vest carrying essentials and an Android phone with Google Maps , Winston set off on his mission in October 2011 . In the last year , he has walked ( yes , walked ! ) through Brunei , China , Laos , Malaysia , Philippines , Singapore , Taiwan , Thailand , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have contributed to his cause , whether it was a place to stay , a hot meal or a monetary donation on his website . <p> Trekking along : Winston , standing in front of a durian fruit stand near Sematan , the westernmost town of Malaysian Borneo <p> Out on the road , Winstons Android phone and Google Maps became " the hub " of his entire operation . He used Google Maps to find accurate and easy-to-use walking directions everywhere he went , whether it was through remote villages and farms , down tiny dirt roads , or across rice paddies and desolate sugar cane fields . " Walking directions in Google Maps were critical to my trek . The directions were accurate and efficientits essential to take the shortest route when you 're walking 20-25 miles each day , " said Winston . " But the best part was being routed onto roads and trails through areas I otherwise never would have discovered with , say , driving directions , or even a physical map . " <p> In addition to using Google Maps , Winston relied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used Google Latitude to keep his family , friends and supporters informed of his whereabouts , and MyTracks to record his speed , distance and the places he visited . He also used Google Translate to communicate with locals , and in one case found it essential : when bit by a stray dog outside of Bangkok , he typed " I got bit by a dog , can someone take me to a hospital ? " into his app . A taxi driver took him to the hospital , where he got 11 shots ! <p> Today , after walking 5,000 miles in 408 days , Sgt. Fiore completes his journey , with more than $65,000 raised for ICSF . The money will help to fund more than 200 life-saving surgeries for children in Southeast Asia and other parts of the world .
