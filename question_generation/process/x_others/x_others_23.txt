Seriously - you can spend a full year living and working at the nexus of development and enterprise ! Of course , there 's an application and an interview process , and Acumen Fund is looking for a specific kind of person - someone with " the moral imagination , the practical skills and the leadership potential to effect real change , " as Acumen Fund 's Deepti Doshi put it on the Acumen Fund blog . <p> If you are interested in the base of the pyramid sector and believe you have the skills and experience to contribute to this mission over the next year , please apply . If you 're happy doing what you 're doing , fantastic . But I 'm sure you know a few people for whom the fellowship is indeed a dream . Please send them our way .
@@13268950 @1868950/ <h> Tuesday 8/19/2008 07:26:00 AM <p> Today , as part of our Renewable Energy Cheaper than Coal initiative , Google.org announced more than $10 million in investments and grants in Enhanced Geothermal Systems ( EGS ) technology . EGS expands the potential of traditional geothermal energy by orders of magnitude . The traditional geothermal approach relies on finding naturally occurring pockets of steam or hot water . The EGS process , by comparison , replicates these conditions by fracturing hot rock , circulating water through the system , and using the resulting steam to produce electricity in a conventional turbine . <p> EGS has the potential to provide clean renewable electricity 24/7 , at a cost cheaper than coal . The ability to produce electricity from geothermal energy has been thought exclusive to locations such as California and Iceland . However EGS could allow us to harness the heat within the earth almost anywhere . To see see the massive size of the US geothermal resource accessible by EGS , check out our Google Earth layer . For more on EGS , watch this video , featuring Dr. Steve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dr. Jefferson Tester , professor of Chemical Engineering at MIT and lead author of a major recent study on EGS : <p> Working with Geodynamics , one of the world 's leading EGS development companies , we modeled Geodynamics ' first 50 MW system at the Cooper Basin in SketchUp , Google 's 3D modeling technology . To see how EGS works , check out the animation of the SketchUp model or download it . <p> EGS is heating up around the world . Australia , Germany , and the European Union are currently leading the technology and commercialization race . All 50 U.S. states , Europe , Russia , China , and India all have substantial thermal resources accessible by EGS . <p> While the US debates drilling in the ocean for oil , we are focused on drilling for renewable energy - and lots of it - right beneath our feet . A recent report by MIT on EGS estimated just 2% of the heat 3 - 10 km below below the continental United States is more than 2,500 times the country 's total annual energy use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help catch up to other nations , including expanded R&amp;D funding , a national renewable portfolio standard , and reliable tax incentives .

Following up his testimony from earlier this month , Dan Reicher , Google.org 's Director of Climate Change and Energy Initiatives , visited Capitol Hill again this week to discuss a new 21st Century approach - harnessing technology to achieve greater energy efficiency and " do more with less . " <p> The hearing , which also featured Ian Bowles , Massachusetts ' Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs , focused on ways in which consumers , businesses , and government can work together to achieve greater energy efficiency . Studies have shown that efficiency opportunities can cut global energy demand to less than half of what is projected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new vision for how America generates , transmits , and uses electricity . He noted that the increasing interplay between energy hardware and information software , along with the rise of the Internet and the connectivity it brings , adds to the potential to make and use energy more productively . From smart meters and smart appliances to smart homes and a smart grid , we are poised to significantly advance our ability to monitor and manage energy . <p> Dan highlighted Google.org 's RechargeIT initiative and discussed the efficiency advantages of plug-in vehicles . He emphasized how the government could help get more plug-ins on the road by providing financial incentives , investing in our national electricity infrastructure , funding R&amp;D , and modernizing our regulatory system to permit real-time pricing of power . <p> Dan 's other proposals include implementing an Energy Efficiency Resource Standard , which would set efficiency resource targets for electricity and gas suppliers . He also called for increased federal support for weatherizing energy inefficient homes in low-income communities , and for improved financial incentives to encourage private-sector investment in promising clean energy technologies .
@@13268951 @1868951/ <h> Wednesday 8/31/2011 03:55:00 AM <p> People often share stories with us about the ways the Internet has helped them during natural disasters . Whether its accessing information about the event , communicating with loved ones during a crisis or finding out how to help respond in the aftermath , the web plays a valuable role . <p> We looked up some statistics from our search data for several natural disasters to get insights into this phenomenon . We see two consistent trends in search behavior and internet use in the affected areas : a substantial ( and often dominant ) proportion of searches are directly related to the crises ; and people continue to search and access information online even while traffic and search levels drop temporarily during and immediately following the crises . While in some cases internet access is restricted due to infrastructure failures , generally Internet Service Providers continue to provide connectivity and users take advantage of it . The findings show just how resilient the internet can be in times of crises , compared to other infrastructure . <p> We expect these trends will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ongoing work of the Google Crisis Response team to improve the information available on the ' net during crises . <p> Joplin Tornado , Joplin , MO , USA , May 2011The week of this years tornadoes in Joplin , Missouri , searches for terms related to help , safety and recovery were significantly up from normal levels . Disaster relief was 2054 percent greater than normal and FEMA , American Red Cross , and National Weather Service showed increases of 400-1000% . Despite the tragedy , in which 25 percent of the town was destroyed and 75 percent damaged , we still saw search traffic at 58 percent of normal levels the day of the tornado , and an immediate recovery toward normal Internet traffic occured within a day of the event . <p> Hurricane Katrina , New Orleans , LA , USA , August 2005During Hurricane Katrina , one of the largest U.S. disasters in recent memory , terms like new orleans , hurricane and katrina topped search queries while search queries for resource providers like FEMA and the American Red Cross grew the fastest , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evacuated from New Orleans , we still saw search traffic at more than 50 percent of normal in Louisiana and 20% of normal in New Orleans , based on the previous five-day average . <p> The Internet has proven to be an essential resource during natural disasters internationally as well . <p> Japan Earthquake and Tsunami , Northern Coast , Japan , March , 2011During the Japan earthquake and tsunami , searches for earthquake information and impacts including terms like outage , tokyo electric power and rolling blackouts gew the fasted and also topped the list of most searched queries across Japan . In fact , even in the hardest hit areas , where mobile and landline communications were disrupted , Internet services were largely unaffected . During this time , people entered 620,000 records into Google Person Finder , a tool developed by the Google Crisis Response team to help people find missing friends and loved ones in the aftermath of such disasters . <p> Chile Earthquake , Maule Chile , February 2010 Immediately following the earthquake , people searching online were actively looking for earthquake information ; earthquake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 queries . Terremoto was the most searched term , and two online news sources , Terra and Emol , and the National Office for Emergencies onemi also appeared as top keywords . While there was no search traffic for 15 minutes after the earthquake , within one day searches had recovered to 25 percent of normal traffic , and search traffic returned to pre-earthquake levels within just four days . <p> Haiti Earthquake , Port-Au-Prince , Haiti , January 2010 The month of the Haiti earthquake , seismeor " earthquake " was the fastest-growing search term , and it continued its surface as a frequently searched term for almost two months after the earthquake . In the capital city of Port-Au-Prince , at the center of the earthquake , search traffic stopped momentarily , but did not completely disappear even when the three submarine Internet cables were cut as a result of the earthquake .
