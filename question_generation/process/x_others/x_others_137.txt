Based on this finding , we launched Google Flu Trends to provide timely estimates of flu activity in 28 countries . Since then , we 've seen a number of other researchersincluding our very ownuse search activity data to estimate other real world activities . <p> However , tools that provide access to search data , such as Google Trends or Google Insights for Search , werent designed with this type of research in mind . Those systems allow you to enter a search term and see the trend ; but researchers told us they want to enter the trend of some real world activity and see which search terms best match that trend . In other words , they wanted a system that was like Google Trends but in reverse . <p> This is now possible with Google Correlate , which were launching today on Google Labs . Using Correlate , you can upload your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popularity best corresponds with that real world trend . In the example below , we uploaded official flu activity data from the U.S. CDC over the last several years and found that people search for terms like cold or flu in a similar pattern to actual flu rates . Finding out these correlated terms is how we built Google Flu Trends : <p> You can also enter a search term such as ribosome and find other terms whose activity corresponds well over time with the one you 're interested in : <p> It turns out cell biology is n't all too popular in the summer time ( sorry biologists ! ) . What 's interesting is that the ups and downs of web search activity for cell biology terms is unique enough that searching on Correlate for ribosome brings up searches for other biology terms , such as mitochondria . Of course , correlation is n't the same thing as causation , so we cant explain why two terms follow the same pattern . But my guess in this case is that both terms are popular when schools teach these concepts . <p> Search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to advances in economics , health and other fields ; but we need to handle that data with privacy controls in mind . With this system , we do n't  care what any one person is searching for . In fact , we rely on millions of anonymized search queries issued to Google over time , and the patterns we observe in the data are only meaningful across large populations .
