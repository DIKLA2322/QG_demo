TV White Spaces--unused channels in the broadcast TV spectrum--have the potential to help cover the last mile of Internet access . The last mile , or final connection to the user , is one of the biggest challenges to improving connectivity in Sub-Saharan Africa and other emerging markets . TV White Spaces are important because they offer available and underutilized spectrum ( especially in less developed areas ) , allow signals to travel over long distances , and can enable a lower-cost alternative for broadband . <p> TV White Spaces are available . Using our spectrum database , we shared a visual of available white space in Senegal . There is more than 90 MHz available in Dakar alone , and more across the country--spectrum that could be used for broadband . Compared to the San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Regulation can pave a path in African markets . ICASA , the South African regulator , plans to use trial outcomes to evaluate possible rules for use of the TV White Spaces . Other regulators showing interest in TV White Spaces for broadband included Senegal , as well as Malawi , where less than 9% of the population receives broadcast TV and many channels are left available . <p> Developing new technologies for TV White Spaces . Radio manufacturers shared how TV White Spaces radios can talk to a database , which tells the radio which channels are available in a given geography . Adaptrum and Carlson presented the results of deployments of these radios , in Kenya and South Africa respectively . <p> From trials to databases to radios , these efforts show that players are stepping up to use TV White Spaces to help enable Internet access in West Africa and beyond . That 's good news for a future where more people have access to the Web .
