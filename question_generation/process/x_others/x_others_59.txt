They committed resources from Google 's profits , equity and substantial employee time to this philanthropic effort , and they created the mission : " to use the power of information and technology to address the global challenges of our age . " They structured Google.org so that in addition to traditional grant making , it can also invest in for-profit companies , advocate for policies and , most important , tap into Google 's strengths : its employees , products and technologies . At first I was skeptical about " going corporate , " but I came on board convinced that Google could make real progress on these issues . I think we have made an excellent beginning , but it is just a very few steps on a long path . <p> Now , three years after Google.org was founded , we 've been reviewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's clear that I am most effective in helping to identify " big ideas " and potential partners , as well as raising awareness about society 's biggest challenges . I am therefore very excited to become Google 's Chief Philanthropy Evangelist . I think this is the highest contribution that I can make both to Google.org and to fighting the urgent threats of our day : from climate change to emerging infectious diseases , to issues of poverty and health care . By focusing my energy outwards I hope to be able to spend more time motivating policy makers , encouraging public and private partnerships , and generally advocating for the changes that we must make as a global society to solve these problems . Long-time Googler Megan Smith will take over day-to-day management of Google.org , joining as General Manager to lead us through this transition , in addition to her existing role as Vice President of New Business Development . <p> One of the first things that Megan will focus on is how Google.org can best achieve its mission . During our review it became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkable non-profit organizations over the past three years , our greatest impact has come when we 've attacked problems in ways that make the most of Google 's strengths in technology and information ; examples of this approach include Flu Trends , RechargeIT , Clean Energy 2030 , and PowerMeter . By aligning Google.org more closely with Google as a whole , Megan will ensure that we 're better able to build innovative , scalable technology and information solutions . As a first step , Google has decided to put even more engineers and technical talent to work on these issues and problems , resources which I have found to be extraordinary . In this global economic crisis , the work Google.org is doing , together with our many colleagues around the world , to help develop cheap clean energy , find and fight disease outbreaks before they sweep the globe , and build information platforms for underserved people globally , is more important than ever . We stand behind the commitment made in 2004 to devote 1% of Google 's equity and profits to philanthropy , and we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our resources have the greatest possible impact for good .
