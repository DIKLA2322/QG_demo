@@13269121 @1869121/ <h> Monday 5/03/2010 11:02:00 AM <p> ( Cross-posted from the Official Google Blog to bring you information on other green efforts at Google ) <p> On Friday we made our first direct investment in a utility-scale renewable energy project two wind farms that generate 169.5 megawatts of power , enough to power more than 55,000 homes . These wind farms , developed by NextEra Energy Resources , harness power from one of the worlds richest wind resources in the North Dakota plains and use existing transmission capacity to deliver clean energy to the region , reducing the use of fossil fuels . Through this $38.8 million investment , were aiming to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy in a way that makes good business sense , too . <p> To reach a clean energy future , we need three things : effective policy , innovative technology and smart capital . Through our philanthropic arm Google.org , we 've been pushing for energy policies that strengthen the innovation pipeline , and we 've been dedicating resources to developing new technologies , including making investments in early-stage renewable energy companies such as eSolar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company investments , but also dedicated funding for utility-scale projects . To tackle this need , we 've been looking at investments in renewable energy projects , like the one we just signed , that can accelerate the deployment of the latest clean energy technology while providing attractive returns to Google and more capital for developers to build additional projects . <p> A clear windy day at the Ashtabula II wind farm <p> Were excited about this first project investment because it uses some of the latest wind turbine technology and control systems to provide one of the lowest-cost sources of renewable energy to the local grid . The turbines can continuously adjust the individual blade pitch angles to achieve optimal efficiency and use larger blades with 15 percent more swept area than earlier generations , allowing capture of even more wind energy for each turbine . The control systems for these wind farms are also advanced and dynamic , allowing for remote 24/7 monitoring and operation to ensure maximum turbine up-time and power production . A couple of us got a chance to climb 80 meters up one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes through a gearbox to turn the generator that makes the electricity . The climb to the top also provided a great view of the entire wind farm ( do n't  worry we all had harnesses and turned the turbine off ! ) . <p> My colleague Matt takes a rest after the 80-meter climb <p> We look forward to finding more opportunities to invest in renewable energy projects that use the latest technologies to push the envelope for delivering low cost clean energy . Well let you know what we find .
