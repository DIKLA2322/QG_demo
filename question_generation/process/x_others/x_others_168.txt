@@13269077 @1869077/ <h> Tuesday 7/20/2010 08:11:00 AM <p> Down a remote alleyway in Dar es Salaam , Gregory Mchopa picks up his paint brush and studies the empty canvas . He closes his eyes and visualizes his next painting , whether that be a group of Maasai women collecting water from a well , or villagers dancing before a brilliant Tanzanian sunset . For years , Gregory has been capturing the rich heritage of the Tanzanian Maasai with painstaking dedication . His delicate strokes against the canvas radiate a warmth and brightness unrivaled by his peers - one that had once never reached far beyond that maze of streets in Dar es Salaam . <p> It was n't until the summer of 2007 that I first had the privilege of meeting Gregory Mchopa and witnessing his work . I had traveled to Tanzania as part of an outreach trip for google.org , during which we met with local businesses in Dar es Salaam and gave presentations with the goal to spark local economic growth . We spoke before local entrepreneurs , established businessmen , and government politicians ; but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maze of streets that we truly recognized the potential for sparking local enterprise . After watching Gregory paint a brilliant work of three Maasai women carrying water over their heads to the backdrop of a sweeping red sky , he sat down to explain the difficulties of being an artist in Tanzania : a limited market , a lack of connectivity , and an absence of distribution channels . <p> Gregory suffered not for lack of passion or talent , but from the lack of technologies and services that could broadcast his work to a far wider audience . After returning to the States , I worked with BRUTE LABS ( a non-profit I founded with several other Googlers ) to build a simple website , www.mchopa.com , that would bring Gregory 's work before a global audience . Using several Google tools that are free and easy to use - App Engine , Checkout , Spreadsheets , Gmail - we developed a website and interface for Gregory that serves as an open source model for other artists in the developing world seeking to showcase and sell their work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has sold 47 paintings and kept all of the profits . Perhaps more significantly , Gregory 's web presence has connected him with gallery representatives and individual collectors in the US , Canada , and the UK , many of whom have requested custom works for display . The culture of the Maasai has now spread to people around the world . <p> Down a remote alleyway in Dar es Salaam , Gregory Mchopa continues to faithfully wield his paint brush , capturing the heritage of his country and people . But through Google 's online suite of tools , he now wields the power to broadcast his work far beyond that maze of streets to a global audience of buyers , suppliers , and admirers . The only question left for us now : who 's the next Gregory Mchopa ?
