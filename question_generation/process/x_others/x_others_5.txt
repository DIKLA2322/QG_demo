@@13268815 @1868815/ <h> Case Studies <h> Global Forest Cover Change <p> A team led by University of Maryland 's Matt Hansen used Earth Engine to survey over a decade of global tree cover extent , loss , and gain . The study , published in Science , analyzed nearly all global land , excluding only Antarctica and some Arctic islands . This area comprises 128.8 million km2 , which is the equivalent of 143 billion pixels of Landsat data at a thirty-meter spatial resolution . To conduct such extensive analysis , Earth Engine performed computations in parallel across thousands of machines , as well as automatically managed data format conversion , reprojection and resampling , and image-to-pixel metadata association .

What would have taken a single computer 15 years to perform was completed in a matter of days using Google Earth Engine computing . <p> - Professor Matt Hansen , University of Maryland <h> Map of Life <p> The Map of Life team has developed an interactive map for conservators to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of individual species . Using Earth Engine to combine data from a variety of sources , Map of Life has refined their predictions for pinpointing the locations of at-risk species . Users can adjust the parameters ( indicating , for instance , a species ' preferred habitat ) , and Earth Engine updates the map on-the-fly , immediately showing the impact on the species range and the amount of protected habitat .

Global Forest Watch uses Earth Engine to measure and visualize changes to the world 's forests ; users can synthesize data from over the past decade or receive alerts about possible new threats in near-real-time . Launched in 2014 , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indigenous groups for applications as diverse as protecting against illegal logging and ensuring supply chain transparency .

Global Forest Watch would not exist without it . For those who care about the future of the planet Google Earth Engine is a great blessing ! <p> - Dr. Andrew Steer , President and CEO of the World Resources Institute <h> Tiger Habitat Monitoring <p> A team led by University of Minnesota 's Anup Joshi developed a satellite-based monitoring system to track changes and prevent loss to critical endangered wild tiger habitats . Using Google Earth Engine , forest loss data generated by Dr. Matt Hansen and Google , and other data available at Global Forest Watch , the team assessed the changes to all critical tiger habitats over a 14 year period . The assessment is the first to track all 76 areas prioritized for wild tiger conservation across 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to double the wild tiger population by 2022 is achievable with effective forest protection and management .

When their tool is released , local health workers will be able to upload their own information about known cases of malaria , and the platform will combine it with real-time satellite data to predict where new cases are likely to occur .
