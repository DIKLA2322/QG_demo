@@13268987 @1868987/ <h> Wednesday 8/12/2009 02:03:00 PM <p> When we launched our Geo Challenge Grants project last fall , we hoped our small grants program would provide nonprofits with the impetus and resources they need to take advantage of powerful online mapping tools like Google Earth and Google Maps . We were , without a doubt , not disappointed . In fact , we were overwhelmed by the hundreds of exciting and innovative geospatial applications that poured in from around the world , addressing diverse issues from renewable energy resources to education . <p> We are excited to announce that we have awarded grants to fourteen organizations with creative geo applications . These projects address important problems through creative and scalable geospatial applications . Grants are awarded either through the Google.org Fund at Tides Foundation or directly from Google.org . <p> Over the next six months to one year , these Geo Challenge Grant recipients will launch their projects and open-source all of the data , making both the projects and the data accessible to people all over the world . We hope these projects will inspire others to use geospatial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application and website that will accept multi-user texts to map and update street vendor locations , integrating data into websites like Yelp and Urbanspoon , and providing information about access to healthy foods to the community <p> Building a dynamic and user-driven online modeling application using existing avian , climate , vegetation , and land use change data to show deviation of avian migration based on climate change scenarios <p> To develop a dynamic Geo Portal interfaced with Google Earth and climate change data to provide a " one stop shop " Internet database for Asian elephant conservation and to identify individual elephants through an automated identification program <p> Developing a dynamic Geo Portal with climate change data to provide a " one stop shop " Internet database for Asian elephant conservation and to identify individual elephants through an automated identification program <p> Using the Ushahidi platform , it will map organizations providing HIV , AIDS and TB related services in Kenya and create a tool that enables organizations without experience of mapping to publish data on HIV , AIDS and TB services in their own countries <h> Friday 8/07/2009 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving the same car : a 2000 Nissan XTerra . It 's been a great car and , after more than 100,000 miles , it has a lot of memories : a ski trip to Lake Tahoe through a blizzard , driving down the I5 to Los Angeles , driving across the entire country and then back ! However , over the last few years I started to feel guilty about the how much gas my car managed to guzzle . The official stats claimed 19 miles-per-gallon on the highway , but they must have been driving slower than I do because I never saw that sort of mileage . So , I was excited when the government approved the " Cash for Clunkers " program ! <p> I talked it over with my wife , and we decided it was time to upgrade to a more environmentally friendly car . We looked around , and decided to get a Toyota Prius . After checking out the Cash for Clunkers website , I figured out that because the Prius is rated at 50 mpg , well more than 10 mpg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were eligible for a $4,500 trade-in value through the program . That made the Prius not only a environmentally friendly choice , but an economically attractive one as well . We found a participating dealer nearby and headed over to trade in our clunker . <p> After a quick test drive and some effective negotiations , we struck a deal and bought the new car . As always , there was quite a bit of paperwork involved , including a few extra pages for the " Cash for Clunkers " program . ( Then again , $4,500 is certainly worth a couple of pages of paperwork . ) After signing on the dotted line , the car was ours . <p> Just today President Barack Obama signed a bill extending funding for this incredibly popular program , which burned through its $1 billion budget in just one week . It 's not often you can get something you want , feel like you 're doing something good for the planet , and get $4,500 for doing it . So consider trading in your clunker for a more fuel-efficient model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2007 Google.org launched our Renewable Energy Cheaper than Coal initiative and announced a $10 million investment in the early-stage clean power company eSolar , Inc . Yesterday in Southern California , eSolar flipped the switch on what is to be the first solar power tower facility in the U.S. that will enter full commercial operation . <p> Success here could signal the emergence of a clean energy technology by which we might -- for the first time -- economically harness the sun to produce large quantities of electricity . And we would be harnessing a massive and , for all practical purposes , inexhaustible energy supply . <p> In many respects eSolar has turned conventional thinking about solar power tower technology on its head in order to drastically reduce the capital and operating cost of solar thermal power plants . Instead of employing a small number of large and expensive specialty mirrors eSolar takes the opposite approach incorporating thousands of small mirrors that can be made cheaply in massive quantities . And instead of having to reinforce large mirrors to stand up to high winds , eSolars small mirrors have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concrete for the mounting structures . <p> Of course this massive number of mirrors requires more sophisticated software so they accurately track the sun leading to high heat output and system efficiency . At Google were particularly intrigued with this aspect of the eSolar product -- that is , how the performance of energy technology can be enhanced by information technology . Call it ET meets IT . <p> The eSolar team has taken a giant step toward cracking the code on solar power tower technology . I 'm hopeful that just a few years from now we will see this facility and many more like it focusing the suns energy to produce a brighter future for our children and the planet they will inherit . <h> 8/06/2009 09:10:00 AM <p> It 's no surprise that the cheapest and most available solution to the climate problem is simply to use energy more efficiently . But a recent study issued by McKinsey &amp; Co. details just how compelling an opportunity we are missing . McKinsey predicts that an annual investment of roughly $50 billion over the next 10 years would cut energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth $1.2 trillion ! The energy savings would be equal to taking the entire U.S. passenger fleet of cars and trucks off the road . <p> Such efficiency gains are possible only if we overcome some major hurdles . For instance , most people have no idea how much energy we use in our homes on a daily basis or which of our appliances or devices are consuming the most energy . That 's one of the reasons that we created Google PowerMeter , a software gadget that shows users detailed information on their home electricity consumption . Studies show that when people have access to this kind information they reduce their energy use by up to 15% . Greater savings are possible if people use the information to buy a more efficient refrigerator or air conditioner , insulate their home , or take advantage of off-peak electricity rates . <p> The McKinsey report acknowledges that energy efficiency alone wo n't solve our energy and climate challenges . We must continue to put major resources into low-carbon sources of energy like renewable energy , and the federal economic stimulus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a good start . But the McKinsey findings are a wake up call . As we enact more comprehensive energy policies , energy efficiency -- and giving people the information , tools and incentives to take advantage of it -- should be front and center . <h> Monday 8/03/2009 03:25:00 PM <p> An international group of scientists , including Dr. Nathan Wolfe and the Global Viral Forecasting Initiative ( GVFI ) , announced today their discovery of the origins of the deadliest form of human malaria - Plasmodium falciparim . The falciparim parasite is responsible for more than one million deaths each year . GVFI , a 2008 Google.org grantee , monitors the spread of disease from animals to humans by analyzing blood and tissue samples collected from high-risk humans ( bushmeat hunters , live-market workers , and more ) and the animals they are in contact with . <p> The finding , documented in today 's edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) , disproves the long-held belief that malaria is an ancient disease that has evolved along with its human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of several new blood samples from chimpanzees in Cameroon and C+te d'Ivoire , has shown that human malaria began as a chimpanzee disease that jumped species ( presumably when a human sustained a bite from a mosquito carrying chimpanzee malaria ) as recently as 10,000 years ago . <p> Why do we care about the origins of the disease ? Firstly , it demonstrates that interspecies disease transfer has been occurring for millennia , and is not a modern phenomenon confined to our more recent experience with HIV , SARS and swine flu . We must monitor this important mechanism of disease emergence if we want to catch the next pandemic , for the sake of our health and the health of generations to come . Secondly , the study has demonstrated that chimpanzees carry a greater diversity of close relatives to human malaria than previously understood . These could be the source of lifesaving new vaccines or treatments for human malaria . <p> Dibamba is a chimpanzee in the Mfou National Park in Cameroon .
