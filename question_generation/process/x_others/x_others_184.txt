@@13269103 @1869103/ <h> Innovation and Policy Enhance Each Other <p> Breakthroughs in clean energy technology can reduce the cost associated with implementing clean energy policies , effectively growing the economy while decarbonizing our energy use . Policies can also amplify the economic , security , and pollution benefits of breakthroughs by creating markets , disincentivizing the highest-emitting technologies , and leveling the playing field for clean energy , leading to increased adoption of clean energy . <p> We set very optimistic rates of innovation , pushing technologies hard on cost and performance . Even with aggressive breakthroughs , we achieved only a 49% reduction vs. 2005 emissions by 2050 in the All Tech Breakthrough scenario , well short of the standard , IPCC-inspired reduction targets of 80% by 2050 . <p> While our optimistic scenarios did not reach 80% , they did make substantial headway . Since innovations in biofuels , agricultural practices , or industrial energy efficiency were not modeled in detail , it is possible that a more comprehensive mix of energy innovation could achieve 80% reductions . <p> Reaching 80% reductions by 2050 will be difficult and likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have today . This analysis points to the need a multi-pronged strategy , combining both innovation and policy to mitigate climate change while growing the economy . <h> Coal is Very Hard to Displace on Economics Alone <p> Coal power is abundant and cheap in the United States , especially from older and fully depreciated plants . Major displacement of coal generation did not occur until clean energy became cheaper than the marginal cost of coal , which occurred predominately after 2030 even with clean power breakthroughs . <p> Post-2030 , breakthroughs in generation became cost advantaged vs. coal and start to pay off significantly . As clean power reached its lowest price points , displacement of coal accelerated rapidly from 2030 to 2050 . By 2050 , the All Tech Breakthrough scenario reduced coal 66% , and the $30/ton Carbon Price + Breakthrough scenario reduced coal use 87% vs . BAU .
