Over 12.4 million people across Kenya , Ethiopia , Djibouti and Somalia are threatened with hunger and disease as they are unable to access basic survival means . UN agencies and other humanitarian organizations are rallying to support refugees on the move , particularly to the thousands fleeing Somalia . Valerie Amos , OCHA Emergency Relief Coordinator , has stated that " This will not be a short crisis . " The emergency is expected to persist at least three to four months , and the number of people needing humanitarian assistance could increase by as much as 25 percent . <p> Fresh and accurate maps are among the many critical factors in assessing such a state of crisis , as they provide vital information to facilitate emergency response and planning . Thanks to the efforts of our satellite imagery partner , GeoEye , we now have high resolution imagery of locations with the most pressing humanitarian needs . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective , by allowing the creation of improved maps over refugee camps in Kenya , Ethiopia and the city of Mogadishu . Volunteers are mapping roads , hospitals , schools , community centers , and water resources , among other vital landmarks . The map data contributed is being shared periodically with the UN agencies engaged in this crisis . Google has also donated 1 million USD to help local and international organizations provide famine and drought relief support in the Horn of Africa . <p> You can help the Horn of Africa during its time of crisis by creating detailed maps using your local knowledge of places , such as cities , roads , and natural landmarks . If you 're unfamiliar with the region , try pairing up with people who have local knowledge , who can help by reviewing and correcting your edits . To participate in these ways and more , and offer feedback , please join our Africa mailing list and visit the Horn of Africa community mapping site as we all map the way toward crisis relief .

" While the delegates continued negotiations on an international climate change agreement , several events highlighted efforts by local communities around the world to confront the climate crisis and secure their own clean energy future . <p> Local cities from Milano , Italy to Betim , Brazil to Bhubaneswar , India shared their experiences deploying renewable energy projects in their cities . In partnership with ICLEI , they have banded together with other cities around the world ( ICLEI map below of participating cities below ) to share expertise and best practices on renewable energy and energy efficiency . <p> The U.S. Climate Acton Network highlighted efforts by U.S. states ( including 9 of the country 's 10 largest emitting states ) to reduce emissions , along with the pledge by over 700 U.S. mayors to meet the Kyoto Protocol targets in their cities and towns .

" We ca n't wait for every detail to be correct at the international level ; we have to act now and we can act now if we act locally . " Monika Zimmermann of ICLEI hopes the ' can-do ' attitude of state and local governments will be contagious . " We 're not just doing the right thing for our own sake , we want to prompt national governments and the international community to follow our lead . "
