@@13269038 @1869038/ <h> Monday 11/24/2008 02:22:00 PM <p> Google CEO Eric Schmidt spoke last Thursday at a Natural Resources Defense Council event held at Google offices in New York . The topic for the evening was " Partnership for the Earth : Strategies and Solutions for Energy Security . " Eric spoke about Google 's Clean Energy 2030 plan and the importance of rebuilding America 's energy infrastructure . <p> The speech was followed by a panel discussion featuring Frances Beinecke , President of the Natural Resources Defense Council , Ralph Cavanaugh , co-director of NRDC 's energy program , and Dan Reicher , Director of Climate Change and Energy Initiatives at Google.org. <h> 11/24/2008 08:59:00 AM <p> Having been in Africa for the past several months , I am beginning to see firsthand how access to information by regular citizens is starting to transform the continent . A single newspaper could be read by as many as 10 people , citizens are willing to rent-a-paper , and FM radio stations are exploding in communities where people are hungry for news , entertainment , and opportunities to make their voices heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . With mobile phone penetration growing everyday and airtime prices falling , people are communicating more than ever before , sending text messages and calling in to radio talk shows . They are expressing their views , sharing their opinions with each other , and communicating their delight or displeasure with government , business , and civil actors in more informed ways . <p> In East Africa in particular , people are bracing themselves for the broadband revolution . Within 12 months , initiatives like Seacom and EasyCom are likely to be active in the region and will connect people in completely new ways . What will happen when the super-highways open their gates ? Will traffic flow in one direction or two ? Will East Africans become net consumers or producers of information ? <p> Last week , Kenya held its first " content " conference arranged by the national ICT Board . Public and private people had plenty to say about " local content " and why it mattered . What started as a technical discussion about connectivity quickly turned to issues of national pride , language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultures . While Kenyans clearly yearn to be part of the global community and consume information far beyond their borders , they also want to be heard , recognized , and contribute to global conversations . They want their news , their music , their issues , and their voices to find a place in the online universe . <p> Today , Swahili books online for example , number in the hundreds compared to the hundreds of millions of books in English available online . What message does this send to young people about the relative importance of their knowledge , language , and culture ? Fortunately , Google translation tools are beginning to address this challenge and launching search in Swahili is creating the right incentives to put more content online . But what else will it take to create symmetry between the number of people who speak a given language and content available to them ? <p> The good news is that there is no paucity of African content in the offline world . Africa is home to some of the worlds richest musical traditions , oral histories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news is that mobile phones are likely to be gateways to the internet in much of the continent . The challenge is how to migrate this wealth of content from the offline to the online world . If Africans are going to get online en masse , they need a reason to go there and they need to see themselves , their values , and their stories when looking through the online prism . With the availability of Google MapMaker in Africa , were already seeing that people are creating their own content and populating base maps with layers that are meaningful and useful to them . That is exciting . Whether its stories , pictures , or data on budgets and literacy rates , I hope we can give people a stake and a reason to get online and participate in the information society . <h> Thursday 11/20/2008 01:27:00 PM <p> With a new President and Congress , we have an unprecedented opportunity to transform our fossil fuel economy to one based largely on clean energy , while creating millions of jobs in the process . <p> Last month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. can dramatically scale up renewable energy , become smarter about how we use energy , and deploy millions of plug-in electric cars . Our energy team has continued crunching the numbers and just posted new data on job creation and cost savings on our knol . We 'll keep updating the information and encourage everyone to take a look and comment - and offer alternative approaches if you disagree . <p> Reaching the goals of Clean Energy 2030 will require a comprehensive effort by the new President and Congress . At a minimum , we believe it should include putting a price on carbon emissions , setting national energy efficiency and renewable energy goals , and modernizing our electricity grid . With the right policies , we can drive trillions of dollars of new investment in clean energy and create millions of new jobs . <p> Stimulating the economy and creating jobs will be the first item of business when the new President and Congress take office in January . We hope that clean energy will be front and center . In its last effort to address the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy , but much more needs to be done . Here are some ideas on how to advance clean energy as part of a stimulus package : <p> Get money flowing to renewable energy . Many wind and solar project developers cant take advantage of the renewable tax credits that were just extended . The continuing economic decline has wiped out profits in many companies - and the otherwise expected tax liability that credits offset . Congress should make changes , such as making the credits refundable , to make it possible for investors to get the value Congress intended . <p> Start building a smarter electricity grid . The last large energy bill passed in 2007 authorized , but did not fund , matching grants and demonstration programs to encourage investment in a " smart " electricity grid . These programs should be fully funded and expanded so more consumers have the opportunity to better monitor and control their electricity use and reduce their bills . A new Department of Energy ( DOE ) sponsored book explaining smart grid describes it as " the internet brought to our electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficient . The DOE has a Weatherization Assistance Program that enables low-income families to permanently reduce their energy bills by making their homes more energy efficient . On average , weatherization reduces households ' heating bills by about 30% . President-elect Obama adopted our proposal to weatherize one million low income homes per year for the next 10 years . Current federal weatherization funding supports barely 10% of that number . A roughly $3 billion appropriation would weatherize roughly one million homes . <p> Green the Government . The U.S. government is the largest consumer of electricity . Accordingly , federal departments and agencies should lead by example when it comes to stimulating the economy through expanded energy efficiency efforts and increased use of clean energy . In addition , the Congress and the President can provide support to State and local governments for efficiency and smart grid projects ; the purchase of renewable power ; and converting vehicle fleets to low-emission vehicles , particularly plug-in electric cars and trucks . Such concerted government action will speed the advent of a new era of energy security and domestic job creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and improve energy security . If you have ideas to share , join the discussion on the Clean Energy 2030 knol . <h> Wednesday 11/19/2008 10:46:00 AM <p> Early readers of the Google.org blog may recall us embarking on a film project portraying public health heroes working in the field to eradicate polio . Gone from the modern world , new cases of polio continue to afflict mostly children under age 3 in the poorest regions of just a few countries India , Nigeria , Afghanistan and Pakistan . When we first announced this project and the collaboration between Google.org and Vermilion Films , filming was underway primarily in India and Afghanistan , documenting the front lines of public health in some forgotten corners of our world . <p> David Heymann of the World Health Organization reminds us , " When you have n't seen a disease for quite a while , which is the case in the industrialized countries , you forget about the terrible disease that it really is . " Polio is such a disease , as it can ruin the lives of children even before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We 're proud to announce The Final Inch , a 38-minute film about the historic global effort to eradicate polio . Here , the story told is as much about the messengers as the message .

Whether you 're interested in U.S. elections , today 's hot trends , or each year 's Zeitgeist , patterns in Google search queries can be very informative . Last year , a small team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond simple trends and accurately model real-world phenomena using patterns in search queries . After meeting with the public health gurus on Google.org 's Predict and Prevent team , we decided to focus on outbreaks of infectious disease , which are responsible for millions of deaths around the world each year . You 've probably heard of one such disease : influenza , commonly known as " the flu , " which is responsible for up to 500,000 deaths worldwide each year . If you or your kids have ever caught the flu , you know just how awful it can be . <p> Our team found that certain aggregated search queries tend to be very common during flu season each year . We compared these aggregated queries against data provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , and we found that there 's a very close relationship between the frequency of these search queries and the number of people who are experiencing flu-like symptoms each week . As a result , if we tally each day 's flu-related search queries , we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this discovery , we have launched Google Flu Trends , where you can find up-to-date influenza-related activity estimates for each of the 50 states in the U.S. <p> The CDC does a great job of surveying real doctors and patients to accurately track the flu , so why bother with estimates from aggregated search queries ? It turns out that traditional flu surveillance systems take 1-2 weeks to collect and release surveillance data , but Google search queries can be automatically counted very quickly . By making our flu estimates available each day , Google Flu Trends may provide an early-warning system for outbreaks of influenza . <p> For epidemiologists , this is an exciting development , because early detection of a disease outbreak can reduce the number of people affected . If a new strain of influenza virus emerges under certain conditions , a pandemic could emerge and cause millions of deaths ( as happened , for example , in 1918 ) . Our up-to-date influenza estimates may enable public health officials and health professionals to better respond to seasonal epidemics and though we hope never to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Epidemiology and Prevention Branch of the Influenza Division at CDC throughout the 2007-2008 flu season , and together we saw that our search-based flu estimates had a consistently strong correlation with real CDC surveillance data . Our system is still very experimental , so anything is possible , but we 're hoping to see similar correlations in the coming year . <p> We could n't have created such good models without aggregating hundreds of billions of individual searches going back to 2003 . Of course , we 're keenly aware of the trust that users place in us and of our responsibility to protect their privacy . Flu Trends can never be used to identify individual users because we rely on anonymized , aggregated counts of how often certain search queries occur each week . The patterns we observe in the data are only meaningful across large populations of Google search users . <p> Flu season is here , so avoid becoming part of our statistics and get a flu shot ! And keep an eye on those graphs if you 're curious to see how the flu season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published an academic paper in Nature , the international journal of science , explaining the science and methodology behind Flu Trends . Check it out for more information . <h> 11/04/2008 11:07:00 AM <p> On September 12 2008 , Cecilia van Deventer , a safari booking agent living in Zambia , was flown to South Africa in critical condition . She died just two days later . By October 6 2008 , three more people had died : the paramedic who accompanied Cecilia to South Africa , the nurse who cared for her in Intensive Care , and the cleaner who cleaned her hospital room after her death . A fifth patient , a nurse who cared for the infected paramedic , is receiving anti-viral treatment . In all cases , people infected were exposed to infected blood and/or body fluids . <p> South Africa 's National Institute for Communicable Diseases ( NICD ) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( US-CDC ) quickly identified the infectious agent as an arenavirus similar to the one that causes Lassa Fever - a disease that affects 500 000 people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sequencing of the viral genome by Professor Ian Lipkin and colleagues at the Center for Infection and Immunity ( CII ) at Columbia University , it has been clearly shown that this is an arenavirus that has never been seen before . Google.org 's Predict and Prevent initiative recently announced a grant of $2.5 million to support CII 's work in pathogen discovery . This identification of a novel arenavirus not only represents an early success , but also demonstrates just why this work is so important . ' There is no doubt we are dealing with a newly emerged virus , ' said Dr. Janusz Paweska , head of the special pathology unit at the NICD in Johannesburg . As Professor Robert Swanepoel , also of the NICD , has pointed out , the virus is ' newly-discovered ' rather than new , and has probably been around in animal populations for some time before making a recent jump to humans . <p> Arenaviruses , normally transferred to humans through contact with the urine of their rodent hosts , can be classified into New and Old World viruses depending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectively . New World arenaviruses , including Junin , Machupo , Sabia and Guanarito , can cause viral hemorrhagic fever . This particular virus , classified as Old World due to its African origins , began as a flu-like illness , then caused diarrhea , pharyngitis and a rash before rapidly culminating in respiratory distress , neurological symptoms and circulatory collapse over a period of about 9-12 days . The virus has yet to receive a name . <p> Due to the swift action of the NICD , US-CDC and CII the outbreak is now described as contained . We commend their efforts !
@@13269040 @1869040/ <h> Tuesday 10/27/2009 08:08:00 PM <p> Electricity consumers in the United Kingdom can now access Google PowerMeter , a free software tool that provides consumers with information on how much energy their home is using . The software receives information from utility smart meters and in-home energy management devices and visualizes this information on a personalized iGoogle homepage . Today we 're announcing both our very first UK utility partnership and our very first UK device partner . <p> Our utility partner , first:utility , is the only energy supplier in the United Kingdom to provide free smart meters to its customers , and is currently in the process of rolling them out across the country . To date , first:utility has over 30,000 customers signed up to its service . Starting in early November , all first:utility customers with smart meters will be able to sign up to use Google PowerMeter , empowering them with greater information about their home electricity use . According to Mark Daeche , first:utilitys Chief Executive , " At the end of the day , if you ca n't measure and view your energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Google is also partnering with AlertMe , a self-install consumer device manufacturer and our first partner with a product available in the United Kingdom .

For example , the Sacramento Municipal Utility District will receive $127 million to install 600,000 smart meters and 50,000 programmable thermostats and home energy management systems . Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company will receive $130 million to provide 771,000 meters to 100% of its customers . These technologies will enable consumers to receive direct feedback on their energy use , which can lead to energy savings of up to 15% on average . Altogether the awards will fund the installation of 18 million smart meters , 1 million in-home energy displays and 170,000 smart thermostats . <p> With the advent of smart meters and other information technologies , we have the opportunity to rebuild the electricity grid , which still uses century-old technology in places . Most importantly , we can make the grid work better for consumers . Today 's announcement is an ambitious step toward that goal . <h> Monday 10/26/2009 09:11:00 AM <p> The first outbreak of the new " swine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year in Mexico caught the world by surprise . Public health officials around the world tried to stop the virus at the borders but were largely helpless . Shortly after , on the other side of the world from Mexico , I saw the health check posts in Cambodia at the airport and at a borderpost with Vietnam , right when the country found its first H1N1 cases which were flown in by US exchange students . The weapons used by the health officials to combat the spread of the virus were primarily paper survey forms and thermometers ; the virus won , very quickly . Genomics is rapidly changing both the way diseases are diagnosed and the way medications and vaccines are developed - but will it give us the tools to prevent the next pandemic ? <p> What if countries where emerging infections originate , from Cameroon to Cambodia , could rapidly sequence suspect samples and discover new pathogens when only a few people have become sick ? <p> What if all such sequence data were immediately shared in a single global open access database ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data and all associated data , annotations or publications as easily and effectively as a Google search ? <p> What if markers discovered for a new disease would quickly be incorporated into affordable hand held multi-pathogen diagnostic tests widely available at the point of care ? <p> What if the results of those tests were uploaded to a database where surveillance tools like Google Flu Trends could discover outbreaks ? <p> Today the Public Library of Science , a mission driven , non-profit and open access publisher , presents " The Genomics of Infectious Disease " a collection of essays , perspectives and reviews that explores how genomicswith all its associated tools and techniquescan provide insights into our understanding of emerging infectious disease .

This exploration often brings us into dialogue with many start-up social enterprises and other philanthropies trying to overcome challenges working directly with less advantaged populations . One such group , LGT Venture Philanthropy , has articulated a recurring theme : organizations with effective and innovative solutions to social and environmental problems often lack the manpower and expertise to implement these solutions in the most effective way , especially during the growth phase . They have come up with a creative solution : the iCats Program . <p> The iCats Program was designed to bridge the gap between philanthropic organizations or social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business professionals with the desire to apply their knowledge and experience to benefit the social sector , thus acting as " impact catalysts .

LGT Venture Philanthropy created a web-based platform to match experienced professionals with specific needs in trusted partner programs . <p> In 2009 , eight fellows are working in organizations in Africa , India , and Latin America . Peter Shrimpton , CEO of Heart in Capetown notes of the iCAT program , " Your funds may have mobilized us , but it is your fellows who are optimizing our performance . If your funds are the vehicle , your fellows are the fuel . " <p> I wanted to share with you that applications for the 2010 iCat Program are now underway .

To help you out , we at Google.org are excited to announce the expansion of Google Flu Trends to 16 additional countries , including much of Europe . We 've also made the site available in 37 languages . Flu is a global threat , affecting millions worldwide each year , so we 're pleased to make this tool available in more regions and languages . <p> Last November , we launched Google Flu Trends in the United States after finding a close relationship between how many people search for flu-related topics and how many people actually have flu symptoms . By tracking the popularity of certain Google search queries , we are able to estimate the level of flu , in near real-time . While some traditional flu surveillance systems may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Google search queries can be counted immediately . Google Flu Trends provides an additional surveillance tool that may help public health officials and the public make more informed decisions about preparing for the flu season . <p> In the past year , we 've expanded our coverage to include Mexico , New Zealand and Australia and have continued to see a good correspondence between our estimates and official flu activity data . In fact , our analysis of last season shows that Google Flu Trends had a close 0.92 correlation with official U.S. flu data . <p> An important aspect of Google Flu Trends is that we filter out terms that may be popular because people hear about them in the news . What we do not use in the models is a term like swine flu since people are more likely to type that into Google because they want to know more information about it , given the news headlines , and not because they actually have H1N1 or swine flu .

This means that utilities can enable self-serve sign-up for customers to use the Google PowerMeter gadget . More users means improved feedback on our product and this will translate into an improved product experience . Here 's how it works : If your utility has open enrollment enabled for your account , with just two simple steps you can have your usage data transmitted to Google and visible online via Google PowerMeter . <p> Yello Strom , a German utility and our first partner in Europe , is fully up and running with open enrollment .

With over 1.4 million customers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very first company to offer commercial smart meters nationwide in Germany since 2008 . Yellos smart meter interacts with a PC to make energy consumption visible for the customer both in real-time within their own household and online at fifteen-minute intervals . Expanding the number of customers who can sign up for Google PowerMeter is just one more way this forward-thinking utility is improving access to energy information . As Executive Director Martin Vesper put it , " We are now offering our customers even more ways to maintain an overview of their electricity consumption with the help of the internet . And when people know exactly what is going on with their energy usage , they can use energy efficiently without sacrificing convenience . " <p> Other Google PowerMeter partners are also working towards open enrollment capabilities . Florida 's JEA has built an open enrollment system and is actively rolling it out within their customer base . And National Information Solutions Cooperative ( NISC ) , the latest addition to our strategic partners , is actively integrating Google PowerMeter into their offerings for all Utility Co-ops that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcement mean that even more users can now see their electricity data to save energy and money ! <h> Monday 10/05/2009 03:43:00 PM <p> Today , we 're very excited to announce we have secured our first official device partner . ( That means having a smart meter installed by your utility is no longer a prerequisite for using Google PowerMeter ! ) For the last several months , a few hundred Google employees have been testing a number of in-home electricity monitoring devices . Those of us lucky enough to have one of these devices installed in our homes experienced first-hand how access to high-resolution energy use information drives meaningful behavior change . So we set out to make that data easier for everyone to access and understand by sending the collected data to our Google PowerMeter software . <p> Combined with Google PowerMeter , the TED 5000 device can help you understand your electricity usage to save energy and money . Energy Inc. is just our first device partner and if you are working for a company that manufactures energy monitors , we 'd like to hear from you . Stay tuned for more !
