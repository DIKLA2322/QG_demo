Weve been looking at the next phase of Google Person Finder and decided to begin hosting the open source project at Google Code . Were inviting the developer community to help improve Google Person Finder and the PFIF data format . <p> Google Person Finder provides a common place to search for , comment on , and connect records from many missing person registries . After the January 12th earthquake in Haiti , a team of Googlers worked with the U.S. Department of State to quickly create a site that helped people who were affected by the disaster . The site was used heavily after the Chile earthquake in February and put in action again in April after the Qinghai earthquake in China and in August for the Pakistan floods . <p> In addition to opening our product for developers , we 've decided its now time to turn off our Google Person Finder instances for Haiti , Chile , China , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serving these missing person records on the Internet indefinitely , so we intend for each instance of Google Person Finder to be running for a limited time . Once an instance has served its purpose , we will archive the PFIF records in a secure location for historical preservation for one year while we work to identify a permanent owner for these records . Assuming a long-term owner can not be found , we will delete the records after one calendar year . For more information , please feel free to review the Google Person Finder FAQ.
