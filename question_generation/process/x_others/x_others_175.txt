@@13269088 @1869088/ <p> War Child Holland believes that even when more conventional learning ca n't happen , meaningful education can not wait . Its Ca n't Wait to Learn approach enables children to learn in informal refugee learning centres , places where there are not enough ( or no ) classrooms or teachers , and even in existing school systems . Ca n't Wait to Learn 's educational games on tablet computers supplement traditional education and ensure that students are able to advance academically . <p> Early research shows that students using the platform enjoy increased academic performance and self confidence . Through continuing to improve the interface and supporting adoption in other affected areas , War Child Holland and partners hope to expand these benefits to 170,000 children and beyond by 2020. @qwx162836 <p> Funding and technical expertise from Googler volunteers are helping War Child Holland and its partners turn their approach into a fully scalable , turnkey solution for student learning in conflict affected areas . Googler volunteers are also developing a comprehensive rollout plan for countries that want to deploy Ca n't Wait to Learn .
