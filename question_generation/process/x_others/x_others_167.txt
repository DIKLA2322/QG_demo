If you 're worried about someone , then click on " I 'm Looking for Someone " and type in their name . If you want to let people know you 're safe or have heard from someone in the area , then click on " I have information about someone " and put in their names and details . As the number of names and records build , the tool will hopefully make it easier for those who are safe to pass on their news to anyone worried about them . <p> We 've also made Person Finder available on mobile phones . You can request status via SMS by sending an SMS to 2662999 ( Globe subscribers ) , 4664999 ( SMART subscribers ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the message " Search " and then the persons name . For example , if you are searching for Joshua Reyes , send the message " Search Joshua Reyes " . <p> These tools are open to anyone to embed on their Web sites - here are instructions for embedding person finder , and you can click the " Share " button at the top of the crisis map to embed or share by email or social media . <p> The more people who contribute to them , the more useful theyll be . <p> Update November 12 : we 're also providing $500,000 , split between two organizations working on the ground , CARE and the Philippine Red Cross , to aid with relief efforts . If you would like to make a donation , we 've provided links to these and other organizations on our crisis landing page . <h> Friday 11/08/2013 07:03:00 AM <h> ( Cross-posted from Google Africa blog ) <p> TV White Spacesthe unused spectrum between TV channelshave the potential to bring wireless broadband access to underserved and rural areas . These low frequency signals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where telecommunications infrastructure is lacking . <p> Google , joined by a group of partners ( CSIR Meraka Institute , TENET , e-Schools Network , WAPA , and Carlson Wireless ) , wanted to help make this potential a reality . In March 2013 , the grouplaunched a six-month trial using TV White Spaces ( TVWS ) to bring broadband Internet access to 10 schools in Cape Town , South Africa . The goal of the trial was to show that TVWS could be used to deliver broadband Internet without interfering with TV broadcast . <p> After six months , the trial has been a success . The participating schools , which previously had slow or unreliable Internet connections , experienced high-speed broadband access for the first time . Teachers were able to use videos in their lesson plans , make Skype calls to other schools , update school websites , and send regular email updates to parents . Students could use educational videos for research . Because the service was better and faster , teachers and learners used the web to enrich the classroom experience . <p> Student uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the same time , multiple sources confirmed that there was no interference with TV broadcast . Trial partner CSIR Meraka Institute performed frequent scientific studies to measure any potential interference over the six-month period . We also provided tools for people to report any interference experience while watching TV . Both the Meraka Institutes findings , as well as crowdsourced reporting , show that the TVWS service did not interfere with local broadcast . Weve published thefinal results for a deeper dive on the outcomes of the trial . <p> ICASA , South Africas communication regulator , plans to use the trial outcomes as inputs into the TVWS regulatory process . This is a big step to bringing this technology to more of South Africa . We also hope the results extend far beyond this trial and can be useful in encouraging others to consider TVWS to help bring the power of the Internet to more people in more parts of the world .
