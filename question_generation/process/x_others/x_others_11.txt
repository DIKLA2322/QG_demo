This lack of exposure and opportunity to assess computer science as a possible career path is particularly damaging to girls and underrepresented minorities . <p> To address these gaps , Code.org is partnering with teachers and school districts to promote the study of computer science at all grade levels by communicating the value of computer science education to administrators and policymakers , developing new online curricula , exposing millions of students to their first coding experiences , and running the yearly global Hour of Code awareness campaign . <p> Since 2014 , more than 300 million Hours of Code have been completed . Code.org has trained more than 50,000 U.S. teachers to begin teaching computer science and more than 16 million students have begun learning computer science through Code.org courses . Code.org has also supported efforts in 11 countries , 31 U.S. states , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access to computer science as part of the K-12 curriculum . @qwx162836 <p> Google.org 's partnership has supported Code.org in many ways . Google 's visual coding language " Blockly " underpins much of Code.org 's educational content and platform . Googlers have volunteered their project management and engineering skills to Code.org . Hundreds of Googlers around the world have also traveled annually to CS Ed Week to introduce students to coding .
