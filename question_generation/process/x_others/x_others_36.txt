@@13268898 @1868898/ <p> In the long run , cheap grid-scale electricity storage can create large economic and environmental benefits for the US . It improves power quality and reliability , lowers power prices by allowing more efficient dispatch , and enables much higher penetrations of intermittent solar and wind than would otherwise be possible . Our modeling indicates that grid storage , when combined with breakthroughs in solar and wind could increase renewables deployment by up to 35% by 2050 . <p> In the short term , much cheaper storage , absent innovations in wind and solar that reduce their cost to below coal , could actually drive an increase in coal consumption . Cheaper storage would enable already cheap coal units to run at peak efficiency 24 hours/day , store energy at night and dispatch it during the day -- reducing the demand for load-following natural gas capacity and ultimately resulting in a slight ( 0.3% ) increase in greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions .
