@@13268828 @1868828/ <h> Monday 6/29/2009 06:00:00 AM <p> Today is a big day for the Google Africa team for several reasons . We 're announcing an exciting partnership between MTN Uganda , the Grameen Foundation and Google , along with the launch of Google SMS in Uganda . This launch makes available the first suite of applications resulting from an endeavor initiated by Grameen Foundation called " AppLab " ( Application Laboratory ) which began over a year ago . AppLab is designed to develop mobile applications that serve the needs of poor and other vulnerable individuals and communities , most of whom have limited access to information and communications technology . <p> At Google we seek to serve a broad base of people not only those who can afford to access the Internet from the convenience of their workplace or with a computer at home . It 's important to reach users wherever they are , with the information they need , in areas with the greatest information poverty . Hence the launch of Google SMS , a bundle of mobile services for users to access content on a range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as sports scores and local news , but for the first time , also includes services such as health and agriculture tips . <p> We are also releasing Google Trader , an SMS-based " marketplace " application that helps buyers and sellers find each other , enabling greater access to markets and trade , especially for those who are most excluded today . With these services , we hope to help alleviate some of the information and access to markets barriers for the poor , especially those in rural areas . So when farmers in Iganga want to sell their maize , they can list it on Google Trader and a miller in another trading center can find and contact them to buy their goods ( see picture below ) . If a pregnant woman has a question about prenatal services , she can text her question to 6001 and get a response right away . Now people in any part of Uganda can easily find the information that is most critical to them . <p> Miller in trading center calling women 's farming group in Iganga to obtain maize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our first major initiative in Uganda , one of the newest locations where Google is setting up operations . Earlier this year , I joined the Google Africa team to lead our efforts in Uganda , where we want to offer valuable services that address real needs . As East African fiber optic cables begin to connect Uganda to the global Internet community , it is vital that the foundation for a thriving Internet economy also be established . Many impressive organizations are focused on this goal , and we hope to enhance these efforts . <p> Finally , this launch represents the team efforts of many local partners , communities and individuals , each of whom played a role in bringing this vision to life . The Village Phone Operators represent our very first set of focus group participants and product development advisors . And the participation of farmers in more distant villages was fundamental in creating the highly local content created by them , for them , through our local partner BROSDI ( Busoga Rural Open Source and Development Initiative ) , in collaboration with AppLab . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , doctors and school nurses stepped forward as leaders in their respective areas and turned this humble mission into a reality . Our partners , Straight Talk Foundation and Marie Stopes International , not only created the content with AppLab based on the input of these many constituents , but forged deep and strong links with the communities where these services are in greatest demand . <p> When we return to these villages with a product that will be developed through their insights , we want to understand if the service truly is having an impact . To this end , we are conducting a social impact assessment with Innovations for Poverty Action , with support from Google.org , to build from the knowledge of what users need most , to understand what works best . <p> We hope these services will help a variety of organizations already doing impressive work to reach a broader audience and those with the greatest need , in new and innovative ways , through the mobile phone . This is the first of many exciting collaborative efforts we will be working on to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa . So to everyone who participated in this effort , we say Webale Nyo !
