Today , were expanding the service to include weather-related alerts for typhoons , blizzards , landslides and more . <p> These new warnings will appear - as earthquake and tsunami alerts do now - on Google Search , Google Maps and Google Now , as well as the Google Public Alerts site , where you will also find minor weather alerts , such as advisories for high surf and dense fog . <p> If you happen to be in Tokyo at a time when a typhoon alert is issued , for example , Google Now will show you a card containing information about the typhoon alert , as well as any available evacuation instructions : <p> Example of a typhoon warning card on Google Now <p> You will also see alerts for severe weather events , like tornadoes and torrential rains , when you search for relevant information on Google Search and Google Maps on your desktop , tablet or smartphone : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tornado warning <p> Example of a torrential rain warning on Google Maps <p> The Japan Meteorological Agency and Rescue Nows commitment to providing this crisis data in a usable format to the public made these new alerts possible .

Or maybe in that city you 're headed to for work or vacation ? " Outbreaks Near Me " empowers users to track and report outbreaks of infectious disease near them in real-time . In addition to following the reports near you with an automatic alerting function , you can even become a disease detective yourself by reporting on outbreaks happening around you . It 's the latest and greatest in grassroots disease surveillance . <p> HealthMap co-founder Clark Freifeld explains , " In releasing this app we aim to empower citizens in the cause of public health , not only by providing ready access to real-time information , but also by encouraging them to contribute their own knowledge , expertise and observations . In enabling participation in surveillance , we also expect to increase global coverage and identify outbreaks earlier . " <p> HealthMap is based at Children 's Hospital Boston . They launched this new application in collaboration with the MIT Media Lab . Please read HealthMap 's press release for more information .

Technology is helping people to connect , engage , and contribute to society and each other like never before.Weve seen developers use our Civic Information API to bring election data to citizens in new and exciting ways . Our live election results maps have been viewed by billions around the world , bringing real-time transparency to elections in Egypt , Mexico , Ghana , and more . Last week , we launched the Kenya Elections Hub for citizens to access the latest news and resources for the countrys presidential election . Beyond elections , technology can improve everyday civic life : the way we connect , engage , access and act on critical government information . Worldwide , organizations are developing new ways to encourage more open and innovative societies . Google.org is supporting two of these leaders--the Sunlight Foundation and mySociety--and their work on tech solutions for civic innovation.We are providing $2.1 million to the Sunlight Foundation to grow their programs for open government data , with a focus on making civic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By opening up information at the city level for developers as well as citizens , Sunlight is creating opportunity for new ideas that can have an impact in local markets.We are also supporting mySociety , providing $1.6 million to build a global platform to equip developers with tools and resources--such as open source code--to more easily and quickly launch new civic apps and services . This initiative can promote collaboration between civic-minded technologists , regardless of geography . For example , a civic app created in Finland might be easily replicated 9,000 miles away by a developer in Chile.Both organizations are working to bring together a larger community--governments , developers , companies , nonprofits , and citizens--with an interest in improving societies . By creating these open platforms today , we can open doors to ambitious new solutions in the future.Posted by Matthew Stepka , VP , Google.org
