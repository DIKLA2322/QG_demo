@@13269031 @1869031/ <h> Saturday 4/30/2011 10:43:00 AM <p> This past week , several devastating tornadoes struck across a wide swathe of the southern United States . Our Crisis Response team is activating to provide data and imagery we hope will be useful to first responders and the general public . <p> In cooperation with our satellite partner GeoEye , we have imagery of the aftermath of several tornadoes , including in Tuscaloosa , Alabama as shown below . We have created several before-and-after comparisons in a Picasa album . <p> This imagery , as well as data sets such as Red Cross shelter locations and tornado touchdown reports , are available in this collection on Google Maps . We will continue to add imagery and data as it comes available . <h> Wednesday 4/27/2011 12:22:00 PM <p> Google Person Finder has been heavily used since the Japan earthquake on March 11 , and we 've received several reports from users who have successfully reconnected with their friends and family . My teammates and I are glad that its been useful , and were grateful to everyone who has contributed to the project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Google Person Finder . As explained on the site , the data has always been publicly available to make it easier to find people you care about . Weve found , however , that this kind of data is most useful immediately after a crisis and becomes less useful as time passes . Out of respect for our users , we do n't  want to publish or keep this information longer than is necessary . <p> Starting today , Google Person Finder will support an expiry date on each record , as described in the PFIF 1.3 open standard . As part of this change , we are setting an expiry date of May 31 , 2011 on all our existing records and deleting archived records from past launches . When you enter a new record in Google Person Finder , you can specify when you want it to expire . It will automatically disappear from Google Person Finder at that time , and it will be gone from our backups within 60 days thereafter . We are also requiring that everyone who uses the Google Person Finder API under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> At any time before a record expires , you can visit the record and click a button to extend its expiry date . We encourage you to provide an email address when you create a record so that we can send you a notice when the record expires . The notice will contain a link , valid for 3 days , that you can use to restore the record before it is permanently deleted . <p> We hope that you never experience a disaster ; but , if you have been affected by one , we hope that Google Person Finder and the other Google Crisis Response tools have been helpful to you and your loved ones . <p> Its questions like these that led us to install solar panels on our Mountain View campus in 2007at the time , the largest corporate solar installation in the U.S. Theyre also what made us decide to donate to Googlers favorite charities based on how often they self-power their commute , whether by bike or by pogo stick . We hope the new website helps you start asking bold questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greener place . <p> In addition to our new site , we 've had a busy few weeks continuing our green streak . We doubled down on greening our energy supply with our second power purchase agreement ( PPA ) in less than a year and made several new investments : at a solar photovoltaic plant in Germany ( our first in Europe ) , and others in the largest wind farm and solar project in the world , bringing our total invested in clean energy to more than $350 million . While the investments wont supply our operations with energy , we believe they make business sense and will spur development and deployment of compelling clean energy technologies . <p> This Earth Day , well continue to ask ourselves what else we can do to bring us closer to true sustainability . We hope that you , and companies across the world , will be doing the same .
