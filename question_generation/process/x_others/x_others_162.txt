The event celebrated the contributions of exceptional mappers from across Africa who have collectively mapped hundreds of thousands of roads , cities and buildings , covering more than half the population in Africa . Participants from places including Burkina Faso , the Democratic Republic of Congo , Ethiopia , Gambia , Kenya , Morocco , Uganda , Rwanda , and Tanzania came together for this unique and inspiring opportunity to tell their stories , learn from each other , and share their mapping experiences using Google Map Maker . Check out the the Super Mappers Conference site for more details . <p> Everyday , I spend hours and hours in front of my computer mapping . My rewards include seeing a smile on the face of someone who sees for the first time the name of his/her street on the Internet , and knowing that someone benefited from the maps I created - kids journeying in the neighborhoods , business owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Africa being mapped and these maps made accessible to everyone . My message to other Africans : do n't  be just a spectator , let 's all share our knowledge and start mapping cities and remote areas . We will soon , together , complete the mapping of our continent ! <p> Im used to seeing maps and thinking of them as a collection of edits or points of interests . It was an incredible feeling to personally meet and interact with the people behind the creation of the many dots on our maps . This was a gentle and welcome reminder that maps are not static . Theyre alive , they 're personal , and they tell the stories of the people who create them . Mapping allows each of us to be a driving force for change and growth in both our immediate communities and the rest of the world . Let 's continue mapping , let 's stay connected through the Map Your World Community , and let 's continue doing amazing things together !
