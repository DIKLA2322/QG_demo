@@13269013 @1869013/ <h> Tuesday 8/31/2010 05:29:00 PM <p> Here in the U.S. I often take for granted the ability to immediately find information on if I might have a cold versus the flu or what vaccinations are recommended prior to traveling abroad . Like a lot of Americans , I often consult health information on the Internet in addition to talking with a medical professional . This information makes me more informed about my own health and more confident in making healthy decisions . <p> In most parts of the world , however , quality information that would help people improve their health is not available online in local languages . In fact , a 2004 Lancet article ( . pdf ) described the lack of access to health information as a " major barrier to knowledge-based healthcare in developing countries . " The authors noted that " among currently available technologies , only the Internet has the potential to deliver universal access to up-to-date healthcare information . " <p> To tackle this issue , we 're introducing a new initiative called Health Speaks which aims to help increase the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are beginning pilot projects to support community-based , crowd-sourced translation of health information from English into Arabic , Hindi and Swahili.We encourage anyone with health knowledge who is bilingual in English and either Arabic , Hindi or Swahili to take part in the pilot projects for Health Speaks . We have chosen hundreds of good quality English language health articles from Wikipedia that we hope will be translated with the assistance of Google Translator Toolkit , made locally relevant , reviewed and then published to the corresponding local language Wikipedia site . To further show our commitment to this cause , we have funded the professional translation of a small subset of these articles . <p> We are additionally providing a donation incentive to encourage community translators to participate . For the first 60 days , we will donate 3 cents ( US ) for each English word translated to the Children 's Cancer Hospital Egypt 57357 , the Public Health Foundation of India and the African Medical and Research Foundation ( AMREF ) for the pilots in Arabic , Hindi and Swahili , respectively , up to $50,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends and neighbors access quality health information in a local language , while also supporting a local non-profit organization working in health or health education . <p> We will undoubtedly learn from these three pilots and iterate on our approach as we learn how best to engage volunteers and provide tools that allow for easy and accurate translation . We hope to one day expand the Health Speaks initiative to include high-quality health content from other publishers and other languages that suffer from a lack of health information online . <p> According to UNESCO , 90% of the content on the Internet exists in only 12 languages . Language should not be the barrier that denies millions of people worldwide the opportunity to improve their health with valuable health information . Please join us in the effort to break down part of that barrier . <p> Update on 10/15 @ 10AM : We are excited to extend the donation incentive period for all three pilots to December 15 , 2010 . However , registration for new participants will close , as planned , on October 31 , 2010 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far . At our events in Egypt , India , Kenya and Tanzania we heard from so many people about the effect quality health information can have in their communities . We 've also received a great deal of feedback on the pilot and , as expected , will iterate on how best to crowd-source the translation of the health information . In the meantime , we 've decided to extend the donation incentive period because we know many community members have begun translating articles , but have not had enough time to complete and publish them . We hope the additional time will allow community members to complete the great work they have started so their communities can benefit .
