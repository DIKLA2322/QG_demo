The forum , now in its fourth year , is organized by Koji Omi , former Minster of Finance and Science and Technology of Japan . The dual theme of the forum was " returning to harmony with nature " and " innovation " . It examined the linked challenges of climate , energy , and water , together with impacts and contributions of the digital , biotechnology , and nanotechnology revolutions . <p> The new Japanese Prime Minister , Yasuo Fukuda , kicked off the meeting by stressing the need to make the transition to a sustainable society through science and technology . There was remarkable consensus in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest challenges we face . Science and technology helped humanity alter the face of the planet at an unprecedented rate , and human activities are now threatening the geo-bio-chemical systems on which all life on earth is based . Science and technology must now be deployed to help regain balance . <p> The most amazing side of the meeting is how " mainstream " this message has suddenly become . As a sustainable development professional , I have gone to environmentalist meetings with pretty much the same message for two decades . Then , however , I was preaching to the converted . Suddenly , mainstream leaders from government , business , and academia are now singing the same song . Al Gores film awakened an environmental consciousness in the general population , and it seems we have finally passed a tipping point ! To me that is great news . <p> There was debate on how to best balance the allocation of resources for climate change mitigation ( i.e. greenhouse gas emission reduction ) and for climate change adaptation ( i.e. increasing societys resilience in dealing with a changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who have contributed the least to global warming but will bear the brunt of its impact - particularly in Africa . There , farmers throughout the continent will face catastrophic crop losses due to increased droughts , people in the highlands of countries such as Ethiopia will be introduced to malaria and East African coastal countries will face sea level rise that can cost up to 10% of GDP . <p> I was there to give my perspective on water-related challenges for science and technology , and although only a handful of the participants shared my area of expertise , I was pleasantly surprised to see this meeting put in its final statement that , " Water , whether it is for drinking or for agriculture , is now one of the most pressing global issues we must deal with . " <p> Japan will chair and host next years G8 summit , and Koji Omi fully intends to have the conclusions of this year 's Science and Technology in Society Forum influence next year 's debate . In a world where small steps count , this meeting was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 06:16:00 PM <p> Posted by Chris Walker , Acumen Fund Fellow <p> Interested in joining a diverse group of young leaders from around the world who are dedicated to reducing poverty ? Want to learn about the role the private sector can play in international development ? Curious what it would be like to help a company based in a developing country address some of its most pressing strategic needs ? If your answer , like mine , is an emphatic yes , it 's not too late to apply for the Acumen Fund Fellows program , which is accepting applications until October 24 for its next class of fellows . <p> Acumen Fund , a non-profit venture capital fund based in New York City , invests in entrepreneurial approaches to reducing global poverty . In addition to providing capital , Acumen Fund offers management support to its investees through its year-long Fellows program . I joined the second annual class of Fellows in September to begin two months of orientation and training in New York . In the first four weeks of the program , the other Fellows and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders , discussed case studies of businesses working in developing countries , participated in leadership development activities , and begun to research the businesses to which we have been assigned . I will soon be heading out to work for an ambulance company in Mumbai , India to assist with its marketing strategy as it strives to meet the emergency medical needs of the city 's poorest . After nine months in the field , I will return to New York for a month to share the lessons I 've learned and wrap up the one-year fellowship program . <p> The program has attracted a diverse group of fellows from around the world who share an interest in meeting the needs of the poorest through sustainable private sector approaches . My own path to the Fellows program is as different as the rest of those in the program . After receiving my Masters degree in public policy with a focus on international development , I worked on a range of international economic issues as well as on development and foreign aid policy at the State Department , the US Treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Having worked on poverty from a high-level policy perspective , I was interested in getting back into the field and learning about the constraints that the private sector faces in developing countries . I was also curious to learn about innovative business approaches that seek to address poverty in a sustainable way . <p> While I have spent my career in government and diplomatic circles , the six other Fellows in the program come from completely different backgrounds . They have worked on microfinance in Kenya , design thinking to solve business problems , refugee resettlement , low-income housing development in Pakistan , and management and organizational consulting . Each of us brings a unique perspective to our discussions of business , international development , and leadership , creating a rich learning environment for all of us . <p> If you 're interested in applying for this unique program , you can find additional information here . <h> Monday 10/15/2007 08:38:00 AM <p> Last week the Nobel Foundation awarded Al Gore and the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) the Nobel Peace Prize . Former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on climate change and his Oscar winning documentary An Inconvenient Truth . The IPCC , a joint project of the United Nations Environment Program and the World Meteorological Organization , was honored for its efforts over the past two decades to educate the world about climate change . Earlier this year , the IPCC issued its strongest statement to date , finding the evidence of climate change " unequivocal " and concluding with 90% certainty that humans are the cause . <p> In awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to leaders in the battle against climate change , the Norwegian Nobel Committee emphasizes that the problem 's effects go beyond climate , and extend to individual security and opportunity . In the award press release they state : <p> " Indications of changes in the earth 's future climate must be treated with the utmost seriousness , and with the precautionary principle uppermost in our minds . Extensive climate changes may alter and threaten the living conditions of much of mankind . They may induce large-scale migration and lead to greater competition for the earth 's resources . Such changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulnerable countries . There may be increased danger of violent conflicts and wars , within and between states ... the Norwegian Nobel Committee is seeking to contribute to a sharper focus on the processes and decisions that appear to be necessary to protect the worlds future climate , and thereby to reduce the threat to the security of mankind . Action is necessary now , before climate change moves beyond mans control . " <p> Al Gore has argued for rising to meet the challenge of climate change from a moral perspective : " The climate crisis offers us the chance to experience what few generations in history have had the privilege of experiencing : a generational mission ; a compelling moral purpose ; a shared cause ; and the thrill of being forced by circumstances to put aside the pettiness and conflict of politics and to embrace a genuine moral and spiritual challenge . " <p> We agree wholeheartedly , and congratulate Al Gore and the IPCC on this historic recognition ! <h> 10/15/2007 07:57:00 AM <p> In partnership with Google.org , Technoserve recently completed the second Believe Begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its annual business plan competition . As a Google volunteer , I had an opportunity to interact with this years participants by teaching a class on presentation skills , judging the final round of the competition , and conducting one on one consulting sessions . I also visited the growing operations of 3 winners from last year and saw firsthand how the Believe Begin Become program has contributed to the success of their business . <p> I was both impressed and humbled by every entrepreneur I met . They all exhibited a level of energy , passion and enthusiasm that was overwhelmingly contagious . Operating in an environment where sound infrastructure is not a given , poverty is a reality , and health issues abound , they are seeking to create and build sustainable businesses that will change their community and their country for the better . <p> This years top winner of the overall business plan competition , Sheila Ocansey ( pictured below , left , with me , right ) , embodies this energy and passion . With FrutyFresh , she plans to package and distribute quality fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sheila was thoughtful enough to bring a sample of her product to her oral presentation , something that impressed all of the judges . I craved FrutyFresh fruit for its freshness , quality , and taste throughout the rest of my stay in Ghana . The other top winners include : Darko Abednego , Stanley Adjei , Yaw Agyei-Henaku , Joseph Brenyah , Savior Deikumah , Nikoe Gavu , Mary Koranteng , Daniel Oduro , and Joseph Tettey . <p> I observed firsthand the promise of what is possible for this years winners through visits with three winners from last year . Nicholas Vordzgbe of City Wash launched his mobile car wash service using a highly profitable , environmentally friendly approach to a common activity . City Wash is capable of washing an SUV with just 2 liters of water ! His next move includes opening a point of service location and expanding his mobile activities . Isaac Bohulu launched Natural Scientific Pharmaceuticals in a style characteristic of Silicon Valley . In a room that should have been his master bedroom , he is running a government approved production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made from completely natural ingredients . Finally , last years overall winner , Joseph Tackie of MeatyFoods , showed us how a shift in his marketing strategy allowed him to quintuple his revenues in one month . While we sampled the butchers spicy sausage , he told us of his plans to open his second store . <p> The Believe Begin Become program was launched with the hope that we would create an ecosystem of entrepreneurs , investors , customers , and employees that contribute to the growth and economic development of Ghana . Participating in the judging process , seeing the operations in action , and spending time with the entrepreneurs provided evidence that this is exactly what is happening . Participants from last year have become customers and/or suppliers of each other . Last years winner was a mentor to at least 3 of the winners from this year . The judges and potential investors have high standards ; not only are they funding these businesses , but they are personally engaged and interested in their success . The program creates employment opportunities and causescapital to flow back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Become program , the newly-created alumni association will help fuel and expand on the already growing ecosystem that has been created .
