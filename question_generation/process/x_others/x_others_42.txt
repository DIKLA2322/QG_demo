@@13269021 @1869021/ <h> Friday 4/02/2010 12:22:00 PM <p> The international community likes to define Liberias recent history primarily through two events : its fourteen-year civil war , which ended in 2003 , and the work of the countrys president , Ellen Johnson Sirleaf , the first democratically elected female leader in Africa . The chart below illustrates both . On my recent trip to Liberia , first with a group of Bay Area philanthropists hosted by the government and then as part of a small group of Googlers on a country visit , I learned more about how terrible the 1980s and 90s were in this small West African nation . GDP -- a crude measure of the health of a nation , but an indicator nonetheless -- dropped 90% as the country endured brutal dictatorship after brutal dictatorship . That decline is the largest in any nation since World War II , and nearly twice the percentage drop that Rwanda , Zimbabwe , and other states experienced during their crises . The good news is that although Liberia essentially had no economy at the depths of the war , GDP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and foreign direct investment has returned . <p> The numbers also tell a third story . Throughout the 1960s and 70s Liberias economy grew at a steady pace in a way that most other African economies did not . The growth was inequitable -- but real -- and the ingenuity and entrepreneurship that drove it are on full display today , albeit in ways that can sometimes puzzle a visitor to the country . <p> During the ten days I was in Liberia my colleagues and I always had a driver ; its the only way for foreigners to get around . The first day we reserved our car for 9:00am but when I looked out the hotel window at 9:02am I noticed the car speeding off with three other passengers . When I frantically called the driver he responded , " My man , do n't  worry -- I will get you to your meeting on time . " And he did . Then there was the night a local friend suggested dinner by saying , " Come on -- this place has a nice outdoor patio at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that did n't  quite sound as inviting as I meant it . " When we arrived our waiter was Frankie , a cheerful eight-year old sporting an Alex Rodriguez Yankees jersey who delivered our food and drink on the jog . At the local family restaurant , everyone pitched in . <p> Like most of Africa , cell phones are ubiquitous in Liberia and are the technology of choice for the vast majority of the population . Our meetings with the mobile providers there could have taken place anywhere in the world . They 're making money but are fiercely competitive with one another , slashing prices and offering new products to gain market share , and desperately trying to expand into new markets like broadband . Their activities are far from philanthropic , but they 're arguably having a more positive affect on Liberians day-to-day life than any other segment of society . The mobile penetration rate is 40% and rising , particularly in rural areas where phones are often the first " big " purchase a Liberian will make . <p> The countrys trademark ingenuity is of course noticeable here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different mobile carriers and switch back and forth depending on coverage and prices ( a noticeably nice option that 's not available in the locked-down U.S. market ) . Since unanswered calls do n't  incur a charge and the person who initiates the call pays more than the receiver , Liberians will also occasionally call and hang up , meaning , " I want talk to you but you can afford this more than I can , so call me back . " Scratch cards , which give you twenty or thirty minutes of talk time , are practically used as cash and are sold virtually everywhere . <p> The past thirty years have been difficult ones for most Liberians , and with an 80% unemployment rate and known war criminals still occupying high government offices , there are still huge problems to address . In the next two years the country will hold elections and most of the UN peacekeepers will withdraw . Watch closely : if both go well , a stable Liberia may finally be back .

For example , in India , the poor often do not know what they are entitled to and what services are available to them . I recently attended an international conference on the Right to Public Information at the Carter Center and learned that there are approximately 70 RTI ( Right to Information ) laws in the world . However surprisingly , little has been done to evaluate whether these laws are accomplishing their stated and unstated objectives . <p> Access to meaningful information is critical to Google.org 's Inform and Empower initiative in India . To help us better understand how to make the Right to Information ( RTI ) more effective in India , we are delighted that Shekhar Singh who is an active member of the people 's movement for the right to information has agreed to conduct a study of the use and implementation of the Act across various stakeholders in India ( including public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and corporate sector ) . The objective of this study is to determine the strengths and weaknesses of the Act , the constraints preventing effective implementation and the ways in which access to information affects people 's lives . <p> By supporting this study , we hope to generate awareness about the Act , explore the possibility of creating tools for Information Commissioners and other government officials to better use the information , and systematize the way RTI requests could made publicly available online or through other channels . We want to help RTI achieve its full potential and hope that this study will be a first step in that direction . <h> Monday 4/21/2008 11:34:00 PM <p> Posted by Shannon Oliver , Associate , Google.org <p> In the spirit of Earth Day , I took a look at how the environmental movement can foster job growth . Here 's what I found : <p> First , what exactly are green jobs and what can they do to spur the U.S. economy and stop climate change ? Simply put , green jobs are jobs that are good for the environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wage . In a recent New York Times article entitled , Millions of Jobs of a Different Collar , the Sierra Clubs Carl Pope stated , " A green job has to do something useful for people , and it has to be helpful to , or at least not damaging to , the environment . " <p> Can the fight against global warming really create millions of these green jobs across America ? With worry about the economy on the rise , it is certainly a hopeful scenario . A recent article in the Oakland Tribune suggests that experts envision just such a future : " If global warming is to be slowed , it will take wholesale change in how electricity is generated , how people travel and how they heat and cool their houses . That means installing hundreds of millions of solar panels , building thousands of wind farms and geothermal plants , engineering new ways to derive energy from renewable sources and weatherizing millions of homes . Green companies are rapidly hiring new workers and indications are they will continue . " <p> For those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please check out my longer post on the potential number of jobs created by a cleaner , greener economy . And have a happy Earth Day ! <h> Friday 4/18/2008 01:32:00 PM <p> Google Earth is a great tool for exploring the world in ways never before possible . Many of the non-profits and other public-benefit organizations that we work with find it especially useful for showing people the remote places where they work and telling their stories in a very compelling way . <p> Have you ever looked at the amazing high-resolution images in Google Earth and wondered when the photo was taken ? Well now you can stop wondering ! Google Earth 4.3 was launched this week , and one of the many new features is the " imagery acquisition date . " <p> Simply zoom in on and move your mouse cursor over the high-resolution imagery ; the status bar will display the date when the imagery was acquired . This will be especially useful for organizations concerned about changes in the environment . <p> For anyone interested in learning more about Google Earth , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woof of Map Action has written a great paper ( 1MB PDF ) that you should check out . It looks at Google Earth 's differences from and relationship with traditional Geographic Information Systems ( GIS ) software , and how it can be used in humanitarian relief and other public benefit work . <h> 4/11/2008 01:16:00 PM <p> Two members of our team recently attended an international conference at the Carter Center on the right to information ( RTI ) . I must admit that I did n't have much knowledge in this area and did n't even realize that the US passed the Freedom of Information Act ( FOAI ) more than 40 years ago . Today , roughly 70 countries have adopted legislation that theoretically gives their citizens the right to ask for and receive from their governments information on any number of issues , including property records , tax files , and identity files . <p> This may sound rather vague and unimportant . But in some developing countries access to birth certificates can be critical in getting access to basic public services like immunizations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when seeking loans ) . For the poor , this access is particularly important , but finding even simple records of identity can be much harder than you might imagine . The ability of bureaucrats to control access to what is " public " puts them in position to make all kinds of demands . For example , getting access to a birth certificate ( technically a public record ) can take months , involve dozens of steps , and include bribes at every stage . Without basic identify documents , the poor are often left without access to essential public services reserved for " official citizens " . <p> Governments increasingly are putting public information online , even in the developing world . However , " online " does n't always mean searchable or crawlable . In other words , you have to know where it is to find it . How would you even know where to look ? Participants at the conference were captivated by the idea of making high value , high impact public records like land registries and identify documents available online in a format @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience in digitizing books and making them available online was cited as the kind of effort that could be useful in helping give people in developing countries access to the public information they need . There is some work already happening at Google on making government records crawlable . <p> The possibility is exciting . Could poor rural people get access to birth certificates , death certificates or land titles one day through their mobile phones ? It 's worth thinking about . Even if they have to pay to access them , the cost of getting access to critical data at important times would more than pay for itself . As the penetration of mobile phones in rural areas has shown , people are willing to pay for access to tools and information that give them what they want when they need it most . <h> Monday 4/07/2008 08:41:00 AM <p> Posted by Amy Luers , Program Manager , Google.org <p> The World Health Organization ( WHO ) has dedicated today , World Health Day 2008 , to raising awareness of the health risks of global climate change . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're glad WHO and its member countries are using today to bring the linkage to the forefront . <p> Climates effects on health are wide reaching . Climate affects the quality of air we breathe and the quantity and quality of water resources . It affects the productivity of agriculture , distribution of pests and disease , and the severity and frequency of heatwaves , droughts , floods , and wildfires . As a result , climate change is not just an environmental issue but fundamentally a human health and livelihoods issue . <p> We are already experiencing the impacts of climate change across the globe . In fact , a WHO report concluded the climate changes since the mid-1970s may have caused about 150,000 deaths in 2000 . The impacts of climate change are disproportionately felt in the poorest regions of the world . <p> Change in WHO estimated mortality per year ( per million people ) attributable to climate change by the year 2000 .

Check out the post by our mapping specialists where they describe the Google Earth layers they developed with scientists researching the affects climate may have on dengue and malaria transmission . You can also download these Google Earth layers here . <p> While some climate change impacts on public health and the environment are now unavoidable due to our past emissions of greenhouse gases , the severity of the impacts will depend on actions we take today to both reduce future emissions and prepare for the changes ahead . At Google.org we are working to reduce greenhouse gas emission by developing utility-scale renewable energy cheaper than coal and accelerating the commercialization of plug-in vehicles through the RechargeIT initiative , while the Predict and Prevent initiative team is working to help prepare the world 's poor to manage the rising number emerging infectious diseases in our rapidly changing world . <h> 4/07/2008 08:32:00 AM <p> With the World Health Organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to climate change and health today , we wanted to show you some cool animated Google Earth layers that illustrate how infectious diseases may spread as the earth warms . Warmer climates make good habitats for mosquitoes . Many diseases , such as dengue fever and malaria , are spread by mosquitoes . As the planet continues to get warmer due to greenhouse gas emissions , these diseases are projected to spread and add to the other burdens of climate change , especially in the developing world . <p> The Google Earth ( KML ) file linked below will show you projections for the changes in transmission of dengue fever around the globe and of malaria in Africa and specifically Zimbabwe .

The Chevy Volt is a plug-in extended-range electric vehicle that operates on a combination of gasoline ( biodiesel , E85 , and gasoline fuels ) and electricity . Its large lithium-ion battery pack allows it to run only on electricity for up to 40 miles . Since 78% of U.S. commuters drive 40 miles or less from work , charging overnight can provide enough energy for most daily commutes . On longer trips , the car uses its combustion engine as a " range extender " but GM still expects it to get about 150 miles per gallon . According to GM , the Volt is expected to save drivers 570 gallons ( or $1368 per year , electricity included ) in fuel cost . <p> Googlers were invited to check out the Volt and ask GM representatives questions about the vehicle as part an effort to showcase different green technologies and educate employees about their potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plug-ins in the coming years , and we look forward to checking out other models on our campus as they become available . However , we also hope to see commitments to a schedule of production from the auto-makers so that cars like the Volt will be more than just displays on our campus . Plug-in vehicles are an important solution for reducing emissions produced by the transportation sector . Of course , by reducing emissions , we reduce our dependence on oil . We are happy to see auto-makers working to make this solution a reality . <h> Monday 12/17/2007 08:25:00 AM <p> Posted by Michael Terrell , Team Member , Google.org <p> It came down to the 11th hour , and then dragged on for an extra day -- but after two weeks of negotiations , delegates at the UN climate change conference in Bali settled on a plan for reaching a new international agreement to fight climate change . The Bali action plan provides a roadmap for negotiating an expanded and strengthened international emissions reduction pact by the end of 2009 . <p> The deal leaves many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emissions reductions goals or targets ; in fact the scientific recommendations on the emissions reductions needed to halt climate change are relegated to a footnote . The plan simply lays out a process to negotiate the emissions targets to succeed the limits set by Kyoto Protocol , which expire in 2012 . It also provides a platform to begin talks to address growing concerns about adaption , deforestation and facilitating transfer of clean technologies to developing countries . <p> At the outset of this conference , we noted that the scale and complexity of the climate crisis demands collective action by the world 's governments . The Bali roadmap , while leaving much to be desired , represents an important step in this process . All the parties are still at the table and are now committed to spending the next two years crafting a more comprehensive global solution to fighting climate change . Many were hopeful that the outcome of the U.S. Presidential election in 2008 will help breathe new life into this process , regardless of whether the President-elect is a Republican or Democrat . <p> But given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how acrimonious the negotiations were , the rest of us ca n't afford to wait for the world to negotiate a new climate agreement . We need to take action now . Fortunately , many people around the world are doing just that . The numerous panels and side events at Bali were filled with examples of concrete actions people are taking now to build a cleaner future . We wrote on how the world 's local governments are launching their own initiatives to fight global warming and how others are working to ensure that any solutions take into account equity and justice considerations . Another hot topic of conversation here was the growing efforts of many companies to reduce their carbon footprints and take a leadership role in promoting smart energy policies . <p> The flurry of activity among all of these groups is encouraging . The result at Bali and the tough road ahead suggests that the international treaty process will not be sufficient to confront this challenge with the speed and scope with which it demands , at least in the short term . To stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether by making choices to reduce our personal carbon footprint , engaging with family and friends in our communities , or elevating the climate crisis to the top of the political agenda . For the Google.org team , it means a renewed commitment to putting our own resources to work . <h> Thursday 12/13/2007 09:15:00 AM <p> Posted by Kirsten Olsen , Project Manager , Google.org <p> Though all 15,000 participants of the UN climate conference have come to Bali to discuss the global response to climate change , there are many points of entry to the debate . Some enter through the policy door , seeking better rules to mandate emissions reductions . Others enter through the investment door , seeking profit from carbon markets and clean technologies . And an increasing number of participants come through the global development door , seeking " climate justice " for poor populations effected by global warming . As Meena Raman of Friends of the Earth International in Malaysia explained , " We all agree that climate change is happening , but now we have to ask the question of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how large that " burden of adjustment " will be is uncertain , but the UN Human Development Report released in anticipation of UN Conference proclaims that " climate change is the defining human development challenge of the 21st Century " and that " failure to respond to that challenge will stall and then reverse international efforts to reduce poverty . " The idea of climate justice comes into play when considering who will pay for climate adaptation when those countries that have done the least to cause global warming bear the greatest cost . Different groups here in Bali have even attempted to put a dollar amount to the cost of adaptation . Oxfam , for example , estimates the cost to be $50 billion per year and far more if emissions are not cut rapidly . <p> For many NGOs in Bali , climate change offers an opportunity to engage a new community of stakeholders and introduce ideas of environmental equity into the debate . Victoria Tauli-Corpuz , the Chairperson of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues , described the phenomenon as a " moment to challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indonesian Civil Society Forum for Climate Justice have sprung up in the past year to address the climate challenge while more established NGOs such as UNICEF have begun to incorporate work on climate justice and adaptation into their work . <p> Even though several side events and exhibit booths here in Bali focus on climate justice and adaptation , they are still a relatively small percentage of the overall NGO representation at the conference . Michael Dorsey from Dartmouth College and the Durban Group for Climate Justice points out that the International Emissions Trading Association ( IETA ) still dominates in Bali with 336 representatives making up 8% of all NGOs listed . That is equal to more than the delegation of Greenpeace ( 2% ) , the World Wildlife Fund ( 1.6% ) and Friends of the Earth ( 1.5% ) combined . <p> One silver lining that is gaining momentum here in Bali is the idea of " green jobs " created in the new energy economy . Most admit that further research on this topic is necessary to determine which sectors of society will benefit most from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice advocates in search for solutions . <h> Monday 12/10/2007 05:18:00 PM <p> Posted by David Bercovich , Project Manager , Google.org <p> The theme today in Bali perhaps could best be summarized by the bumper sticker maxim , " think globally , act locally . " While the delegates continued negotiations on an international climate change agreement , several events highlighted efforts by local communities around the world to confront the climate crisis and secure their own clean energy future . <p> Local cities from Milano , Italy to Betim , Brazil to Bhubaneswar , India shared their experiences deploying renewable energy projects in their cities . In partnership with ICLEI , they have banded together with other cities around the world ( ICLEI map below of participating cities below ) to share expertise and best practices on renewable energy and energy efficiency . <p> The U.S. Climate Acton Network highlighted efforts by U.S. states ( including 9 of the country 's 10 largest emitting states ) to reduce emissions , along with the pledge by over 700 U.S. mayors to meet the Kyoto Protocol targets in their cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Berkeley 's solar home financing plan ; Chapel Hill , North Carolina 's free public transit ; and the City of Austin 's plan to power all city facilities with 100% renewable power . <p> The flurry of local activity represents some frustration with the pace of international action , according to German Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul . " We ca n't wait for every detail to be correct at the international level ; we have to act now and we can act now if we act locally . " Monika Zimmermann of ICLEI hopes the ' can-do ' attitude of state and local governments will be contagious . " We 're not just doing the right thing for our own sake , we want to prompt national governments and the international community to follow our lead . " <h> Wednesday 12/05/2007 05:59:00 PM <p> Posted by Michael Terrell , Team Member , Google.org <p> This week , representatives from 190 countries are gathering in Bali , Indonesia to begin framing an international climate change agreement to succeed the Kyoto Protocol , which expires in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activists , local politicians , NGOs , businesses and others -- responding to the call for action . <p> The talks come on the heels of a comprehensive assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) that presents the most sobering news on global warming to date . The IPCC , recent winner of the Nobel Peace Prize , concluded that evidence of global warming is " unequivocal , " with 90% certainty that humans are the cause . According to IPCC Chairman Rajendra Pachauri , urgent action is needed to combat climate change , or the consequences for the planet could be " disastrous . " <p> The good news is that the IPCC has identified a wide a range of solutions for curbing greenhouse gas emissions that are both technologically feasible and economically competitive . Here at Google we are working to accelerate some of these technologies through our our recently announced Renewable Energy Cheaper than Coal initiative , Google.org 's RechargeIT program , and our 1.6 MW solar installation . <p> But our own efforts can only get us so far . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world must chart the path to a clean energy future collectively . <p> Over the coming days , we 'll share our reflections and the stories of those who are there . You can also check out the live webcast of the conference . <h> 12/05/2007 05:06:00 PM <p> Posted by Dr. Amy Luers , Team Member , Google.org <p> Last week an Associated Press story highlighted the fact that climate change is contributing to the rise of infectious diseases . According to the article , several hundred cases of chikungunya fever -- a virus that in past has only been common in Africa and Asia -- have been reported recently in Italy . Rising temperatures are creating new breeding grounds for diseases to emerge , and the expanded movement of people and goods are increasing disease spread worldwide . <p> This European outbreak is one of a series of recent warning signs of the mounting risks that our changing climate poses to human health . While everyone in the world face risks from emerging infectious diseases and other threats associated with global warming , the poorest people are most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing worldwide to address climate change by reducing emissions of greenhouse gases . The bad news is that even with aggressive global action to reduce emissions , the climate will continue to change for decades as a result of previous emissions . Scientific research suggests that if actions could be taken to immediately stop the rise in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations , the inertia of the climate system is such that 0.5C ( 0.9F ) or more of additional global average warming would still occur . <p> One thing is certain : the future will hold more changes and more surprises , and we need to be prepared . Those of us on the Google.org team are working at the intersection of climate change , global public health , and poverty to help reduce the vulnerability of the world 's poor to the emerging diseases of the future .
