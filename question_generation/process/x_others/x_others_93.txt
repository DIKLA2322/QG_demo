Which sounds great , but if our country is , as some say , " the most generous , " we should ask ourselves a few questions : why are there growing numbers in line at food banks ? When will American people give as much per capita for international aid as the Netherlands , for one ? <p> Researchers like me live for tough questions like these . So now that the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana Universityand Google are tackling the issue of charitable giving and the proportion that is focused on the needs of the poor in the U.S. and on international aid , I expect my job to be very interesting for a long time to come . <p> Were off to a great start . Yesterday we released the first Center on Philanthropy/Google studyPDF which used data from Center household surveys about giving . Google executive Sheryl Sandberg authored an April Wall Street Journal op-ed titled " The Charity Gap " ( subscription ) using some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study , we use data about the types of charities that people ( households ) give to and estimate the share that is focused on the needs of the poor . For example , we found that about 8 percent of charitable dollars given by households goes for programs " helping to meet peoples basic needs . " We estimate another 23 percent supports poverty-alleviation activities at other types of charities -- for example , employment skills training at neighborhood centers . There is still more work to be done to illuminate corporate giving , which is allocated differently than household contributions . In fact , one of the fastest growing areas for corporate donors is international aid , an area where Google.org has made significant commitments . <p> And we are n't done yet . The household surveys ask about why people give , so we can look at motivations , too . In one interesting contrast , we found in early analysis of another survey that nearly 6 in 10 people said they want to help people in need -- but nowhere near 60 percent of the dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shelter . Stay tuned for more from this combined research effort . <p> The Census Bureau reports 37 million people in the U.S. live in poverty . Half of the worlds population lives on less than $2 per day . Anyone can respond with charitable dollars . Research like this can help us understand where our money goes and what it helps to accomplish . <h> Friday 7/20/2007 09:27:00 PM <p> Posted by Irene Taylor Brodsky , Founder , Vermilion Films <p> I 'm en route home from a three day shoot in Lattimore , North Carolina with a woman who contracted polio in 1948 and lives in an iron lung . <p> In 1994 , Martha Mason wrote a book called " Breath " about her life , which is how I found her . Her memoir not only brings to life the polio epidemics of the 1940s ; her descriptions take you inside the cocoon of steel she has lived in for nearly 60 years . The iron lung encases all but her neck and face . Inside the lung lies Martha 's inert body , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mechanical bellows sucking air in and out of the air-tight chamber . The six foot-long chamber runs on electricity and gives Martha her every breath . Something as banal as a power outage or a tripped circuit could end her life within four or five minutes . <p> And yet it never has . Everything about Martha tells you she is a survivor . She became paralyzed with polio just days after her only brother , Gaston , died from it . Her parents knelt down and made a deal with God in 1948 : If He would spare their only remaining child , they would dedicate their lives to caring for her . And care for her they did for 50 more years , until their own deaths . Today , Martha still lives in the house where she first got sick , a simple farmhouse just down the street from the Baptist Church in her town of 300 people . Back in the 60s , Martha spent four years at Wake Forest University ( where she graduated Valedictorian ) , otherwise , she 's pretty content to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nearest Wal-Mart or gas station , is 13 miles away . <p> Hillary Clinton 's saying is , " it takes a village , " and in Martha 's case , Lattimore has helped keep her going all these years . " It 's been a pretty good ride , " she kept telling me in her characteristic good humor . She has three round-the-clock caregivers , one of whom she taught to read 20 years ago . Martha gets a visitor just about every day , and a local friend set her up with a voice-recognition computer which she uses " to travel the world . " ( She also reads four newspapers a day . ) The Baptist Church tapes its service every Sunday for her . The doctors make house calls . Even though polio seems all but disappeared in this country , in this tiny American town , they have n't forgotten it . How can they ? They have Martha . <h> Monday 7/02/2007 03:15:00 PM <p> Posted by Alix Zwane , Researcher , google.org <p> I first got to know google.org while on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a joint Harvard/UC Berkeley study on cost-effective water investments in developing countries . The Millennium Development Goals call for reducing by half the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water . This goal was adopted in large part because clean water was seen as critical to fighting diarrheal disease , which kills 2 million children annually . Together with my teammates Edward Miguel , Jessica Leino , and Michael Kremer , I 've been undertaking field-based research to assess the effectiveness of water quality improvements in western Kenya . There is compelling evidence that provision of piped water and sanitation can substantially reduce child mortality . However , it 's expensive , which has led many poor countries to instead provide community-level water infrastructure , such as wells . But somewhat surprisingly , we actually know very little about how well these kind of investments do at reducing the diarrheal disease burden . Our research is intended to provide rigorous evidence on this question . <p> Our approach measures the impact of spring protection , a process that clears and seals off the source of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeping from the ground . Naturally-occurring springs are an important source of drinking water in western Kenya , but they 're vulnerable to contamination when left unprotected , particularly from human and animal fecal matter . A locally-based non-governmental development organization ( NGO ) is protecting 200 springs in Busia , Kenya over a four-year span , and they 've kindly let us tag along . <p> Taking E. coli as our fecal indicator bacteria , our preliminary analysis suggests that spring protection leads to large improvements in source water quality . Not all of these improvements translate to improved water quality at home perhaps 70% but recontamination during transport and storage may be less of a concern than is sometimes claimed . We 're still trying to figure out whether these water quality gains have led to child health improvements ; either way , our findings will help us understand the benefits of achieving the water Millennium Development Goal . <p> I should also mention that I 'm now a full-time Googler funny how life happens ! so stay tuned here for future research updates . In the meantime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) if you 're interested in reading more about reducing diarrheal disease in developing countries . If the evaluation of source water quality improvements is more your thing , this article 's good too ( PDF ) . <h> 7/02/2007 10:29:00 AM <p> Posted by Irene Taylor Brodsky , Founder , Vermilion Films <p> We were shooting our third attempt to record an " azhan , " a Muslim call to prayer , when we met Gulzar . As a woman , I have n't been allowed into mosques , but I 've stayed determined to somehow get my crew inside of one to record the beautiful , haunting , beckoning sounds heard five times a day throughout Muslim neighborhoods all over India . These calls mingle with bad static , reverb , or a low hum over low-quality outdoor loudspeakers . A crude transmission , perhaps , but an unforgettable sound . <p> That day in Meerut , my camera man and sound man were in the neighborhood mosque while I waited outside , intently listening to what our camera was recording inside . A crowd started to gather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but because of our jeep and the two women left alone in it . We were a curiosity . A diminutive man with a wide smile ambled up to our car , " May I kindly know , Madam , what you are doing here in our neighborhood today ? " He was paraplegic , with a steel walker around the front of his five-foot-tall body like a miniature Colosseum . His walker was very worn out , and was at least three or four inches too short for him in a way that made his back lean over and his smile look up . I explained our film . He keenly listened to every word and replied simply , " My name is Muhammad Gulzar , and I am a polio survivor . Madam , may I help you ? " <p> I 'm not a superstitious person , but I could n't help but feel as I drove away that day with his phone number in my pocket that all of my earlier failed attempts to film a call to prayer ( the first time we did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masked the sounds ... ) had but one purpose : To lead me to this mosque , on this corner , to this polio survivor named Gulzar . <p> An educated and unemployed Muslim , Gulzar volunteered with our crew over the next two days and eventually opened his doors to us to film him . After two weeks of filming the effort to eradicate the disease in India , it was there in Gulzar 's home that we finally saw polio up close and personal . He was 24 years old , but in the privacy of his home he had to crawl like a baby . In public , he wore calipers on his legs , and his hands bore the calluses of someone who carries his own weight every day on a frame of steel . His family ( one of the most loving and supportive I 've known ) clearly makes every accommodation for Gulzar , but the realities of public life can be cruel . There are no handicap ramps into buildings , no adjustable lifts onto buses no way , I realize , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of India 's best and brightest , but how , I wonder , can Gulzar possibly get to a job ? Mobility is his greatest challenge . <h> 7/02/2007 09:49:00 AM <p> Posted by Greg Miller , Managing Director , google.org <p> Last fall our team spent time talking with philanthropies and other organizations with long histories of successful interventions in the field of global public health . Considering many ideas , we talked about what it will take to finally eradicate polio in the developing world , and the role that philanthropy can play . Many of our parents remember what it was like to have polio in this country , and a few people in the States still reside in iron lungs . These generations are advancing , and it 's important that we not forget how horrible the crippling of polio can be to those who are at risk today . <p> The community of nations , health workers and funders have come very close to wiping polio off the map : in 1988 over 350,000 cases of polio were reported ; last year that number had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under age 3 in just a few countries India , Nigeria , Afghanistan and Pakistan . Several donor organizations have been raising funds for polio eradication for decades , such as the Rotarians who have raised and given more than $600 million for polio eradication . Although the finish line is in sight , the global effort needs all of our support to reach the end goal . <p> Along with other efforts here , google.org is funding a documentary film with Vermilion Films Founder , and Emmy and 2007 Sundance award winner Irene Taylor Brodsky , to tell the story of the public health heroes on the front lines of polio vaccination and eradication . We 're hopeful this film will re-energize the group of dedicated donors and health workers to bring this campaign over the finish line . Throughout the project , Irene will share a few stories from the field . <p> And yes , welcome to the google.org blog . We are fortunate to be able to occasionally post to the Official Google Blog , and today we 're starting a blog of our own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Googlers about what they 're working on , and by our grantees and partners on ideas and insights they want to share with all of you . We hope to include some of their reports and updates , as well as thoughts shared by guest bloggers.
