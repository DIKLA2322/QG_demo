@@13269011 @1869011/ <h> Wednesday 3/31/2010 01:58:00 PM <p> We appreciate TechCrunchs early April Fools story but have no comment at this time other than to say that this has nothing to do with our exploration of marshmallows as an alternative energy source . They work for kids ; why not for data centers too ? <h> Friday 3/26/2010 04:04:00 PM <p> ( Cross-posted from the Official Google Blog to bring you information on other green efforts at Google ) <p> Tomorrow from 8:30 to 9:30pm local time , hundreds of millions of people around the world will switch off their lights and participate in Earth Hour , the largest climate awareness event ever held . As climate change will effect people on every continent , we think a united , global call for action to address the problem is needed . <p> At Google were working hard to be part of the solution for the climate crisis . A first step was pledging to be a carbon neutral company . Our web-based services run in some of the worlds most efficient data centers , we deploy renewable energy where viable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we cant otherwise eliminate . <p> Even with these efforts , however , there remains an urgent need for clean , affordable electricity . To that end we have a team of engineers working to develop technology breakthroughs that will help make carbon-free electricity an economically viable alternative to electricity from coal . <p> Were also putting our experience with organizing information to work , so we can enable others to do projects in the sustainable space . We recently announced , for example , Earth Engine , a computational platform that enables global-scale monitoring and measurement of changes in the Earths forests . And were working with our peers through Climate Savers Computing to cut the power used by computers in half . <p> We also want to help you achieve your personal energy reduction targets . Most people do n't  know their own direct energy footprint , so we launched Google PowerMeter to give detailed , near real-time information about home energy usage . We also like to encourage everyone to set their computers power management to avoid wasting electricity when its not being used . <p> Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago when I was a teenager and living under their roof . They were often exasperated to find the lights on in rooms I 'd just left , and it took years for them to convince me that I could choose something to eat without standing in front of the fridge with the door wide open . The point is , I had to learn to become a steward of the environment . We can help many more people take steps toward better care of the environment , and make that learning curve easier to climb . <p> Turning off the lights wont solve the climate crisis , but its a start . Earth Hour gives individuals a simple , meaningful way to participate in a global call for change . As U.N . Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated , " Earth Hour is a way for the citizens of the world to send a clear message they want action on climate change . " <p> So I hope you 'll gather your friends and family and join me , and hundreds of millions of others , in turning off the lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Tuesday 3/23/2010 03:07:00 PM <p> At Google , we are encouraged to experiment and tinker to see if there is a better way of doing things . We want to encourage others in the energy monitoring space to do the same . To this end , I 'd like to introduce our most recent strategic partner Microchip , which is a supplier of cost-effective , innovative products for the embedded developer . Today , Microchip will include as part of their developer demonstration environment the Google PowerMeter API library that we recently announced . This integration will make it much easier to create devices compatible with Google PowerMeter which means one can more quickly go from concept to demo to product . <p> The Google PowerMeter API is designed to work with a variety of energy monitoring devices - from utilities with smart meters , back haul networks and enterprise scale meter data management systems - to small embedded consumer devices that can send energy information directly to Google PowerMeter . <p> Google 's belief in open source also means that the Google PowerMeter API library is available to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinkerers and makers are welcome to explore the code and use it in their products . <p> As we search for clean energy alternatives , it is important that everyone - from utilities to garage inventors - get a chance to try out new technologies and methods so that we all benefit from their inspirations . <h> Monday 3/15/2010 05:41:00 PM <p> Google PowerMeter now gives you the ability to share your data with others . What does this mean ? Everyone in your household can now activate Google PowerMeter on her own personalized iGoogle page so families and roommates can all track their energy consumption online together . <p> You can also share your data with friends or other Google PowerMeter users to get advice on your usage , compare trends or even strike up a friendly competition to see who can save the most . After all , how can you keep up with your friends , the Joneses , when you do n't know how much they are consuming ? <p> Members of the Google PowerMeter team routinely compare their energy usage data and share energy saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by comparing his PowerMeter data with his friend 's data during a heat wave , a fellow Googler discovered that his home air-conditioning system was consuming much more energy than his friend 's system . The friend lives in the same area and in a similar sized house . By sharing this data , the Googler found out that his air conditioner was malfunctioning , and after making the necessary repairs , was able to reduce the amount he spends on electricity for air conditioning . <p> All sharing is completely opt-in and your privacy will still be protected . If you are already a Google PowerMeter user , please visit our help center to get started . Do n't have Google PowerMeter yet ? Visit our website to see how you can get it . <p> We hope that this feature sparks some interesting energy-related conversations between you and your friends ! <h> 3/08/2010 10:56:00 AM <p> What do tracking flu , helping consumers monitor their home electricity use , slowing deforestation and , perhaps most importantly in 2010 , helping the people of Haiti have in common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of Google.org over the last year , they also show what our technical teams can accomplish in critical areas that do n't always get the attention they need and deserve . <p> A year ago we outlined our goals for the next chapter for Google.org . We talked about our vision to use strengths of Google in information and technology to build products and advocate for critical policies that address global challenges . Ideas for projects continue to pour in from Googlers and partners around the globe , and we 're incubating several new projects in the areas of economic development , clean energy and access to technology . <p> Introduced Earth Engine , a new computational platform we have begun building for global-scale analysis of satellite imagery to monitor changes in key environmental indicators like forest coverage , at COP15 in December . <p> Responded to earthquakes in Haiti and Chile , with maps , updated earth imagery , and networking projects , and built Person Finder to help people find information about their loved ones after a disaster . <p> Advocated for policies to spur innovation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and our engineers worked on ways to reduce the cost of solar thermal and other RE&lt;C technologies . <p> We will continue to greenlight large scale engineering projects that build on Google 's strengths in technology , our computing infrastructure and global teams . <p> Overall , our philanthropic mission at Google includes our Google.org projects and a range of other initiatives - from grants , scholarships and other charitable giving programs to in-kind product support for non-profits . Our founders have set a goal of devoting approximately 1% of Google 's equity and yearly profits to philanthropy . In 2009 , we devoted around $100 million plus in-kind giving to a broad range of philanthropic efforts . Here are some highlights : <p> Academic scholarships and awards : We provide scholarships to encourage students of various backgrounds , ethnicities and gender to excel in their studies in hopes that these and other programs will help dismantle barriers that keep women and minorities from entering computing and technology fields . <p> Academic grants : We support the next generation of engineers and maintain strong ties with academic institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our mission . We fund projects across a variety of subjects , host visiting faculty members at Google , and have launched the Google Fellowship Program to fund graduate students doing innovative research in several fields . <p> Holiday charitable gift : We made $22 million in donations in 2009 to a couple of dozen deserving charities around the world to help organizations that have been stretched thin by more requests for help in a year of fewer donations . <p> Employee gift matching : Google matches up to $6,000 for each employee 's annual charitable contributions and contributes $50 for every five hours an employee volunteers through our " Dollars for Doers " program to encourage employee participation in charitable causes . <p> Charitable Giving Council : We support grants for Googler-led partnerships on causes such as K-12 educational initiatives in science , math and technology . <p> Community affairs : We invest in communities where Google has a presence around the world , creating opportunities for Googlers to invest time and expertise , engage in local grant making and build partnerships with local stakeholders . <p> In addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to free tools to help charitable groups promote their cause , raise money , collaborate with others and operate more efficiently . Google Grants , for example , offers in-kind AdWords advertising to non-profit organizations . Since the program began , we 've donated over $625 million worth of AdWords advertising to all kinds of charitable organizations . <h> Wednesday 3/03/2010 09:55:00 AM <p> Today we 're excited to introduce the Google PowerMeter API on code.google.com , for developers interested in integrating with Google PowerMeter . This API will allow device manufacturers to build home energy monitoring devices that work with Google PowerMeter . We 're launching this API in order to help build the ecosystem of innovative developers working towards making energy information more widely available to consumers . <p> In today 's launch of the API on code.google.com we are highlighting the core design principles towards integrating with Google PowerMeter .
