Well , below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards summer heat in the northern hemisphere , half of the globe has colder weather and more flu activity on the way . Just as we expanded Google Flu Trends to much of Europe last fall in advance of the winter flu season , were bringing Google Flu Trends to eight additional countries in the southern hemisphere where winter is approaching . <p> We now show national estimates ( and a few regions too ! ) of flu activity for Argentina , Bolivia , Brazil , Chile , Paraguay , Peru , South Africa , and Uruguay , bringing our grand total of countries with Google Flu Trends estimates to 28 . As flu affects millions every year , these estimates made in near real-time give health officials an additional early warning tool which can help them to respond more quickly to flu outbreaks . This can be especially important when people from many countries converge in one place , like in South Africa for the World Cup . South Africa is the first country were adding in Africa , and we hope Google Flu Trends will provide useful information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newly added countries are near the equator which means they wont show a strong seasonal peak of flu activity . Brazil provides a neat example of how the flu season in a country becomes more pronounced as you are further away from the equator . In Cear+ , a Brazilian province that is nearer to the equator , the Google Flu Trends estimates generally do n't  show a strong peak . The chart below shows the current season curve as compared with last years curve : <p> You can , however , see a stronger peak emerge as you move further south , away from the equator . Rio Grande do Sul offers a fine example of this , again comparing the current season with last year : <p> Where more people are searching , our models will likely be more robust . We wont be able to provide flu-related estimates if people are n't  searching for flu-related information online . In the U.S. we 've given estimates that are more than 90% accurate as compared with the CDCs ILINet data from which our model was built . <p> Upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an updated model . Just as we updated the U.S. model one year after launching , today were also updating the Australia and New Zealand models . We 've retrained these models with an additional year of surveillance data and they should better reflect current activity levels . <p> You can also see animated Google Flu Trends for the world in the Google Earth layer now also available on the website . This video visualizes flu activity over the last two years in North America and Europe :
