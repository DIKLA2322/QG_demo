@@13269111 @1869111/ <h> Wednesday 12/16/2009 02:37:00 PM <p> I 'm here in Copenhagen this week , at the COP15 International Climate Change Conference . Whether you 're attending in-person , or reading news headlines from home , you ca n't miss the fact that addressing climate change requires the world to solve a mind-boggling mix of science , policy and political issues . These are formidable challenges , but new technologies can help provide solutions for these complex problems . For example , one of the most promising areas of compromise has been an accord to compensate countries for preserving forests and other natural landscapes that play a crucial role in reducing emissions . Implementation of the agreement , known as Reducing Emissions From Deforestation and Forest Degradation , or REDD , will require the ability to accurately track deforestation at a regional and global level . <p> Despite the widespread availability of global satellite imagery through products like Google Earth and Google Maps , it has n't been easy for tropical nations to understand the state of their ecosystem , and to quantitatively monitor changes in forest coverage or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announce a new computational platform for global-scale analysis of satellite imagery : Earth Engine , powered by Google . <p> At an event today hosted by Avoided Deforestation Partners , global leaders from the President of Guyana to the Prime Minister of Norway expressed their support for REDD . Earlier today , the U.S , Australia , France , Japan , Norway and Britain pledged $3.5 billion over the next three years to protect rainforests . At the event , I demonstrated a prototype forest monitoring application built on top of Earth Engine that we developed together with the Carnegie Institution for Science , IMAZON and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation . Traditional forest monitoring is complex and expensive , requiring access to large amounts of satellite data , lots of hard drives to hold the data , lots of computers to process the data , and lots of time while you wait for various computations to finish . Our prototype demonstrates how Earth Engine makes all of this easier , by moving everything into the cloud . Google supplies data , storage , and computing muscle . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a second over the web , instead of the minutes or hours that traditional offline systems require for such analysis . The prototype applications running on Earth Engine are n't yet available to the public , but you can see screen shots in our earlier blog post . <p> We want to ensure this technology is widely available when it 's ready , so today I formally announced Google.org 's commitment to provide our Earth Engine free to tropical countries to support their forest monitoring programs . I believe that this is just the first of many Earth Engine applications that will help enable scientists , policymakers , and the general public to better monitor and understand the Earth 's ecosystems .
