On May 20, 2020, Australia's proposal for an independent investigation into the traceability of the pneumonia virus was endorsed by 194 member states and passed at the World Health Assembly. Australia's proposal for an independent investigation had been opposed by China before the vote, and even after more than 110 countries expressed support for an independent investigation into the virus at the World Health Assembly, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian reiterated Beijing's position at a regular press conference, saying it was too early to conduct such an investigation while the outbreak was still unfolding. Australia's insistence on pushing for an independent investigation has led to a deterioration in relations with China. China's ambassador to Australia, Cheng Jingye, warned the Australian government that Australia's approach would lead to discontent among Chinese consumers and that Australia's wine, beef and other agricultural products and tourism would be boycotted. When the proposal was passed by the WHO, the Chinese Embassy in Australia criticized Australia's attitude of pushing for an independent investigation with a consciousness of victory as a "joke".
