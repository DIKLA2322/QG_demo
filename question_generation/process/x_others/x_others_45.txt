Our Crisis Response team is activating to provide data and imagery we hope will be useful to first responders and the general public . <p> In cooperation with our satellite partner GeoEye , we have imagery of the aftermath of several tornadoes , including in Tuscaloosa , Alabama as shown below . We have created several before-and-after comparisons in a Picasa album . <p> This imagery , as well as data sets such as Red Cross shelter locations and tornado touchdown reports , are available in this collection on Google Maps . We will continue to add imagery and data as it comes available . <h> Wednesday 4/27/2011 12:22:00 PM <p> Google Person Finder has been heavily used since the Japan earthquake on March 11 , and we 've received several reports from users who have successfully reconnected with their friends and family . My teammates and I are glad that its been useful , and were grateful to everyone who has contributed to the project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Google Person Finder . As explained on the site , the data has always been publicly available to make it easier to find people you care about . Weve found , however , that this kind of data is most useful immediately after a crisis and becomes less useful as time passes . Out of respect for our users , we do n't  want to publish or keep this information longer than is necessary . <p> Starting today , Google Person Finder will support an expiry date on each record , as described in the PFIF 1.3 open standard . As part of this change , we are setting an expiry date of May 31 , 2011 on all our existing records and deleting archived records from past launches . When you enter a new record in Google Person Finder , you can specify when you want it to expire . It will automatically disappear from Google Person Finder at that time , and it will be gone from our backups within 60 days thereafter . We are also requiring that everyone who uses the Google Person Finder API under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> At any time before a record expires , you can visit the record and click a button to extend its expiry date . We encourage you to provide an email address when you create a record so that we can send you a notice when the record expires . The notice will contain a link , valid for 3 days , that you can use to restore the record before it is permanently deleted . <p> We hope that you never experience a disaster ; but , if you have been affected by one , we hope that Google Person Finder and the other Google Crisis Response tools have been helpful to you and your loved ones . <p> Its questions like these that led us to install solar panels on our Mountain View campus in 2007at the time , the largest corporate solar installation in the U.S. Theyre also what made us decide to donate to Googlers favorite charities based on how often they self-power their commute , whether by bike or by pogo stick . We hope the new website helps you start asking bold questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greener place . <p> In addition to our new site , we 've had a busy few weeks continuing our green streak . We doubled down on greening our energy supply with our second power purchase agreement ( PPA ) in less than a year and made several new investments : at a solar photovoltaic plant in Germany ( our first in Europe ) , and others in the largest wind farm and solar project in the world , bringing our total invested in clean energy to more than $350 million . While the investments wont supply our operations with energy , we believe they make business sense and will spur development and deployment of compelling clean energy technologies . <p> This Earth Day , well continue to ask ourselves what else we can do to bring us closer to true sustainability . We hope that you , and companies across the world , will be doing the same .

But weve only scratched the surface on the potential of the Web . Today , 5 billion people still do n't  have access to the Internet and the opportunity it provides.Google is doing work to get more people connected , especially in places where Internet access lags the most . In Sub-Saharan Africa , we 've created programs such as Google Apps Supporting Programs for Education , offered technical assistance such as caches for Internet providers , and generated ideas to build Internet capacity . To help bring the next billion people online , Google.org is announcing today our support of two organizations that share our mission to connect the world : the Network Startup Resource Center ( NSRC ) and the Internet Society ( ISOC ) . We are providing $3.1M to the NSRC to grow their work to bring local network engineering expertise to universities and national research &amp; education networks ( NRENs ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , NSRC will provide hands-on training on campus network planning , deployment , and management for over 600 university and NREN staff .

IXPs play a big role in core Internet infrastructure , allowing Internet Service Providers to peer locally ( and cheaply ) , which can lower end user costs , promote competition , and improve user experience . ISOC will create a toolkit for those who want to create and improve IXPs and build an industry portal to share IXP information and data.Some of the brightest minds are working to improve lives in new ways through the Internet . By supporting the work of NSRC and ISOC , we can make sure that those opportunities are available to more people in more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Principal , Google.org <h> Thursday 2/14/2013 08:37:00 AM <p> " I am standing in a partial enclosure made of sticks and plant fronds .

Based on this finding , we launched Google Flu Trends to provide timely estimates of flu activity in 28 countries . Since then , we 've seen a number of other researchersincluding our very ownuse search activity data to estimate other real world activities . <p> However , tools that provide access to search data , such as Google Trends or Google Insights for Search , werent designed with this type of research in mind . Those systems allow you to enter a search term and see the trend ; but researchers told us they want to enter the trend of some real world activity and see which search terms best match that trend . In other words , they wanted a system that was like Google Trends but in reverse . <p> This is now possible with Google Correlate , which were launching today on Google Labs . Using Correlate , you can upload your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popularity best corresponds with that real world trend . In the example below , we uploaded official flu activity data from the U.S. CDC over the last several years and found that people search for terms like cold or flu in a similar pattern to actual flu rates . Finding out these correlated terms is how we built Google Flu Trends : <p> You can also enter a search term such as ribosome and find other terms whose activity corresponds well over time with the one you 're interested in : <p> It turns out cell biology is n't all too popular in the summer time ( sorry biologists ! ) . What 's interesting is that the ups and downs of web search activity for cell biology terms is unique enough that searching on Correlate for ribosome brings up searches for other biology terms , such as mitochondria . Of course , correlation is n't the same thing as causation , so we cant explain why two terms follow the same pattern . But my guess in this case is that both terms are popular when schools teach these concepts . <p> Search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to advances in economics , health and other fields ; but we need to handle that data with privacy controls in mind . With this system , we do n't  care what any one person is searching for . In fact , we rely on millions of anonymized search queries issued to Google over time , and the patterns we observe in the data are only meaningful across large populations .
