Neil is touring the country in a soon-to-be converted 1959 Lincoln Continental Mark IV named Linc-Volt , spreading the word about plug-in hybrid electric vehicles ( PHEVs ) and vehicle-to-grid technology . As part of the trip , Neil and his crew are filming a documentary of their travels and the folks they meet along the way . <p> Neil piloted the big white Continental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get a closer look at the RechargeIT program , including Machu Picchu and our solar charging station . Orchestrating the tour were our own Larry Brilliant , RechargeIT Project Manager Kirsten Olsen and Lead Engineer Alec Proudfoot , Google Green Czar Bill Weihl , and Green Business Operations Associate Lacy Caruthers . <p> Regarding his vision for the Linc-Volt and its unique potential to draw attention to sustainable transportation solutions to combat climate change , Neil summed it up this way : " Classic Americana from then meeting the Americana of now . " <p> From Mountain View , the journey continues to Wichita , Kansas , where the Mark IV will be converted from a carbureted gas guzzler to a bio-diesel series PHEV . After Neil 's fall tour and annual Bridge School Benefit Concert , the Linc-Volt will undergo interior restoration . Then the **26;470;TOOLONG will power on to Detroit ; back to its factory in Wixom , Michigan ; and then to the east coast . <p> We look forward seeing the Linc-Volt in its full electron-powered tailfin glory back in Mountain View , and ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you happen to see a ' 59 MK IV whirring into your rearview mirror , get your wits about you because a rock legend is about to pass you in a chromed bio-diesel PHEV . As he notes about this epic journey , " We all charge the grid in our own way . " <h> 9/12/2007 08:39:00 AM <p> Posted by Kirsten Olsen <p> Since Google.org launched the RechargeIT initiative in June as part of our efforts to stop global warming , a lot has happened in the world of plug-in vehicles . Automakers have made key announcements about future plans for plug-ins . Our grantee , the Electric Power Research Institute ( EPRI ) , along with Natural Resources Defense Council ( NRDC ) , released a comprehensive assessment that found that widespread use of plug-in hybrids could dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions . The charge for electrified transportation is heating up , and we could n't be more excited . But consumers still ca n't buy plug-in vehicles and that 's a problem . It 's time for us to put some money where our mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Today , Google.org has issued a request for investment proposals ( RFP ) to the tune of $10 million in order to advance sustainable transportation solutions . We are inviting entrepreneurs and companies to show us their best ideas on how they can contribute to this important cause . We need catalytic investments to support technologies , products and services that are critical to accelerating plug-in vehicle commercialization . That is why we have structured this RFP to offer investment dollars to for-profit companies to promote social and environmental change . The severity of global warming requires solutions from NGOs , governments , individuals and ( very importantly ) the private sector . We have already made $1 million in grants to a group of outstanding non-profit organizations , and want to expand our impact by spurring innovation in the private sector . While $10 million is a fraction of the total investment needed to transform our transportation sector , we hope this RFP will help catalyze a broader response . We need the automakers to bring these cars to market , but plug-in vehicles also need an entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this type of open call for proposals is not the usual model for investment , but we wanted to use a process that was open to new ideas and new entrants . Part of our goal is to get as many people as possible to work on solutions to our vehicle emissions challenges . We welcome and expect to receive submissions from a wide variety of companies -- from cutting edge battery technologies to innovative service businesses and from companies of all sizes . We also encourage participants from all over the world to submit proposals . This is a global challenge , and it will take all of us to solve it . <p> This open RFP process is a new approach to mission-focused investing , and we 're interested to see what we can learn from it , both in terms of opportunities and gaps that exist in this space today , as well as ways that we can improve on this solicitation process for future investments . Our focus on learning is the primary reason we decided to narrow this first RFP to investments in private companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We will continue to make grants as part of RechargeIT and other programs , but we 're excited today to announce our first foray into investments.To learn more , read the RFP . <h> Monday 9/10/2007 11:11:00 AM <p> Posted by Daniel Conrad , Senior Business Analyst , Google <p> Joseph Tackie is the CEO of Meaty Foods Limited , a high-end butcher in Ghana . He 's also the winner of last year 's Believe Begin Become ( BBB ) business plan competition ( run by TechnoServe and sponsored by Google.org ) , and the elected president of the BBB Ghana Alumni Association . <p> I had a chance to meet with Joseph a few weeks ago in Accra , when Google.org sent me to join this year 's BBB class at their graduation . He told me about the progress of his business one year since his graduation . <p> DC : I heard that you quintupled sales in one month after winning seed capital from BBB last year . How on earth ? <p> JT : See , the difficulty of our environment is that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect you to have already made it , to have already become successful before they invest . They are not going to finance your marketing . With the seed capital from BBB , I was able to create a very good billboard . That 's all it took . People would see the billboard and come in and want to see what it was that we were doing . And our sales quintupled in just one month . <p> Three weeks ago I got my certification from the Ghanaian Standards Board . It cost a lot of money , and this is the type of thing that nobody will finance because they see you as a start-up . Now I can sell to any supermarket in Ghana.When you are a start-up , none of the banks wants to do business with you . But with a little success , now they are chasing you to do business with them . <p> DC : What are your future plans for your business ? <p> JT : First , we are developing our outlets . We have one store now , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We also have a request to set up a similar processing facility in Mali . They have lots of beef in Mali but no high-end processing . <p> DC : What did you learn from the BBB program ? <p> JT : What really made the difference with the program was the networking . Because the program is organized by entrepreneurs it is very practical . They are like role models . Your anxieties are things they have experienced , so you can share with them . <p> Working with entrepreneurs breaks down the fears and anxieties . Issues to do with risks are minimized . You are exposed to success . A lot of people are afraid to venture because of the losses they have dealt with . But working with other entrepreneurs enables you to look forward . The obstacles will always be there , but you will be equipped to go around them . <p> There have been a lot of people saying foreign aid is bad . But this is different . It is like you are teaching me to fish . This BBB program empowered me.
