The inaugural award is meant to celebrate success and provoke conversations about ways to emulate and expand upon the success stories honored . We are thrilled about this honor for CalCars and not the least bit surprised that their contribution to the field of plug-ins has been recognized by such a prestigious organization . CalCars founder Felix Kramer has been instrumental in evangelizing about the benefits of plug-ins and strategically influencing key decision makers about their potential to dramatically reduce carbon emissions . There is no doubt that CalCars has already made history with their role in promoting this technology and we are proud to be a supporter of the organization . <h> Wednesday 3/26/2008 10:12:00 PM <p> Posted Niki Fenwick , Google.org <p> With the price of gas topping $3.75 this week here in California , drivers will be pleased to learn about the official launch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international competition ( with a $10 million purse ) designed to inspire a new generation of viable , super fuel-efficient vehicles . Teams are already busy designing , building and working to bring to market 100 MPGe vehicles that people want to buy , and that meet market needs for price , size , capability , safety and performance and , most importantly , are clean . NBC showcased some concept carsin their Today Show coverage of the competition and the announcement even garnered a shout-out from car enthusiast Jay Leno . <h> Monday 3/24/2008 05:43:00 PM <p> Posted by Bennet Marks , Google.org volunteer <p> Google.org recently hosted the aids2031 Young Leaders Summit at Google 's headquarters in Mountain View , CA . More than 40 leaders in the fight against HIV/AIDS , most of them between 20 and 40 years of age , traveled to the conference from over 15 nations , including South Africa , Rwanda , Norway , the United Kingdom , China , Thailand , Bolivia , Argentina , the U.S. , and Mexico . <p> aids2031 is a consortium of partners - including doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and political scientists - who have joined together to explore what we 've learned from the fight against HIV/AIDS during the first quarter-century of the epidemic , and to come up with options and plans for changing the course of the epidemic over the next quarter-century . <p> According to latest estimates , about 33 million people are living with HIV ( Human Immunodeficiency Virus ) , which causes AIDS . The disease has already killed about 25 million people . Sub-Saharan Africa has been hit especially hard , but the disease is spreading rapidly in other regions . AIDS does n't only have calamitous effects on the health of individuals , but wreaks havoc on the economic and social stability of the countries affected . For more detailed information , see UNAIDS ' 2007 AIDS Epidemic Update . <p> Some of the many topics discussed at the conference included : <p> Using modern technology , including the 3.3 billion mobile phones currently in use , to educate young people about AIDS prevention and treatment , and involve them in the fight against HIV/AIDS . <p> Identifying and mentoring young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dialogue among AIDS activists . <p> Creating a Global Health &amp; Development Corps , modeled on the Peace Corps and similar groups , that can organize and support young volunteers to go wherever they are needed to work on local health issues . <p> Many of the conference participants will be reuniting in August in Mexico City at the XVII International AIDS Conference . We are proud to have supported this convening as a critical part of aids2031 and its efforts to engage young leaders in the prevention of global health threats . <h> Thursday 3/20/2008 11:34:00 PM <p> Posted by Adam Borelli , Team Coordinator , Google.org <p> The California Air Resources Board ( CARB ) is considering changes to the Zero Emission Vehicle Program ( also commonly known as the " ZEV Mandate " ) on March 27th at its Board meeting in Sacramento . This is big deal . <p> The ZEV Program , in short , is a regulation that requires major automakers to produce a certain number of ZEVseach model year in order to do business in California . Some of the credits may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as hybrids and plug-in hybrids that include some advanced , low polluting components . The ZEV Program does not treat all vehicles equally ; it gives fuel cell vehicles the most credits , then pure electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids , followed by a host of advanced vehicles like hybrids . The ultimate objective is to improve California air quality . <p> Google.org has been talking with Board Members , staff , and stakeholder groups to understand their perspectives on the proposed changes to the regulations . After meeting with them , we decided there are five recommendations relating to the proposed changes that we will submit to the Air Resources Board . Our hope is that when approved and implemented , the ZEV Program will accelerate innovation and reduce air pollution by getting large numbers of vehicles into consumers hands and on the road . <p> 1 . Strengthen the newly proposed " enhanced AT PZEV " category to require a minimum capability to drive in pure electric mode for 25 miles to accommodate the commuting range of a majority of drivers and make the vehicles more useful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least 10,000 electric or fuel cell vehicles total from 2012 to 2014 , not the proposed 2,500 vehicles . <p> 3 . Do not allow the electric and fuel cell vehicles sold in other states to count towards the credits for the California requirement ; placing vehicles in other states will not result in the necessary net improvements in California air quality . <p> 4 . Maintain the credit sunset for less efficient , lower power hybrids ; the current proposal asks to extend these credits indefinitely . <p> 5 . Do not increase the credits for Neighborhood Electric Vehicles ( low speed vehicles similar to electric golf carts ) ; they are not driven like full-function vehicles that are the focus of the ZEV Program . <p> To learn more about CARB , the ZEV mandate , and what you can do , check out a more detailed post on our new RechargeIT blog. <h> 3/20/2008 10:20:00 AM <p> Posted by the RechargeIT Team <p> Power on ! Not that we have anything against the sound of exhaust streaming out of a tailpipe , but electrified transportation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the environment , and energy security . Google.org 's RechargeIT initiative is launching a blog . This blog will cover an array of plug-in topics , including vehicle technology , battery technology , RechargeIT 's projects and data , policy , interviews , and interesting snippets from newspaper articles and current events . Some posts will be very technical , others less so , and some not technical at all . The one binding characteristic is that we hope all posts will be interesting . <p> We would like to encourage you all to sign up for our discussion list here . We look forward to hearing your thoughts on our posts and the ideas they provoke . We will be signed up to the discussion list and can answer questions you have about our blog posts , but the discussion list is mainly for you to discuss the posts further.Not familiar with RechargeIT ? The RechargeIT initiative is a project of Google.org in which we converted four Toyota Priuses and two Ford Escape hybrids to plug-in cars using the Hymotion-A123 system . We use these vehicles as a test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( we will discuss the particular data in a future post ) . We also issued a $10 million RFP for plug-in and component technologies , engage in policy debates as with the ZEV Mandate ( we will discuss this in a future post too ! ) , we fund promising nonprofits and researchers to continue their important work , and work with the stakeholders to better understand this space and help them in any way we can . <h> Wednesday 3/19/2008 02:35:00 PM <p> Posted by Joanne Stevens , Associate , Google.org <p> Undeterred by Atlanta 's recent bout of bad weather , 2500 delegates from around the globe arrived on Sunday to participate in the sixth International Conference on Emerging Infectious Diseases . Practitioners and researchers representing the fields of human health , epidemiology , veterinary medicine , ecosystem science and more , convened to discuss the drivers of emerging infectious diseases and strategies to improve our capacity to detect and respond to threats . <p> Dr. Larry Brilliant , Google.org 's executive director , delivered a plenary address to a packed auditorium on Monday morning . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow us to shift our interventions " two steps to the left " of where we are today . <p> Dr. Brilliant spoke about the use of Internet and mobile technology to improve our digital detection of diseases . He highlighted HealthMap as an example of an organization that is using online data sources to produce a global disease alert map . Dr. Brilliant also noted the importance of using new technologies for genetic detection . We know , for example , that over two-thirds of all new emerging diseases are of animal origin . By collecting and analyzing samples at the human/animal interface , we can begin to discover new viruses and study how they are able to jump species . He also discussed vulnerability mapping , a means to identify hot spots at increased risk . By integrating data on landscape , ecosystem dynamics , climate , and demographics we might be able to identify areas of the world where diseases are most likely to emerge , allowing for more targeted surveillance and preparedness activities . <p> Through our very own Predict and Prevent initiative , Google.org hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing and adopting these more proactive approaches . <h> Tuesday 3/18/2008 02:27:00 PM <p> Posted byChris Busselle Google.org <p> Earlier today , we launched Google for Non-Profits , a website tailored to the needs of non-profits where people can learn about products that will help make their important work just a little bit easier . <h> 3/11/2008 03:03:00 PM <p> Posted by John Lyman , Associate , Google.org <p> Last month , Google and Google.org gathered a group of development NGOs together in Washington D.C. to discuss and learn about new technology tools . Because non-profits ' budgets are tight and available funds usually go towards mission-related programs , many organizations do n't prioritize technology . Google 's goal was to highlight free or cheap technologies that NGOs can use and let NGOs share experiences on how they have effectively used various technologies . <p> There were a few lessons learned : <p> There 's a huge hunger in the non-profit sector for more help in this area . Even hands-on sessions for an hour can make a real difference . <p> Although technology tools are getting easier to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking advantage of them . <p> Development NGOs , like other NGOs or businesses , have different technology needs based on size , mission , and budget . There is no one-size-fits-all model that works for them . <h> Wednesday 3/05/2008 10:02:00 AM <p> Posted by Michael Terrell , Program Manager , Google.org <p> Yesterday Google.org , along with representatives from the business and venture capital community , called on the U.S. Congress and the Bush Administration to work together to quickly approve extensions of the Production Tax Credit ( PTC ) and Investment Tax Credit ( ITC ) . The PTC and the ITC are tax incentives designed to spur the market for renewable energy and are critical to financing a new renewable energy generation . The credits are currently scheduled to expire on December 31 , 2008 . <p> Speaking at a news conference at the Washington International Renewable Energy Conference , Dan Reicher , Google.org 's Director of Climate Change and Energy Initiatives , said : " We are at the dawn of a green energy revolution that could fundamentally reshape the way the world generates energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to drive investment in clean energy and push these technologies out of the lab and into the mainstream . Policy makers can make or break this revolution . " <p> In a recent ACORE letter to Congress , over 350 industry leaders warned that a failure by Congress to immediately pass ITC/PTC extensions could jeopardize U.S. job creation and over 42,000 MW of planned renewable energy projects currently in development in 45 states . ( That 's an amount equivalent to 75 base load electricity generation stations and enough to power 16 million homes. )
