@@13269038 @1869038/ <h> Monday 11/24/2008 02:22:00 PM <p> Google CEO Eric Schmidt spoke last Thursday at a Natural Resources Defense Council event held at Google offices in New York . The topic for the evening was " Partnership for the Earth : Strategies and Solutions for Energy Security . " Eric spoke about Google 's Clean Energy 2030 plan and the importance of rebuilding America 's energy infrastructure . <p> The speech was followed by a panel discussion featuring Frances Beinecke , President of the Natural Resources Defense Council , Ralph Cavanaugh , co-director of NRDC 's energy program , and Dan Reicher , Director of Climate Change and Energy Initiatives at Google.org. <h> 11/24/2008 08:59:00 AM <p> Having been in Africa for the past several months , I am beginning to see firsthand how access to information by regular citizens is starting to transform the continent . A single newspaper could be read by as many as 10 people , citizens are willing to rent-a-paper , and FM radio stations are exploding in communities where people are hungry for news , entertainment , and opportunities to make their voices heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . With mobile phone penetration growing everyday and airtime prices falling , people are communicating more than ever before , sending text messages and calling in to radio talk shows . They are expressing their views , sharing their opinions with each other , and communicating their delight or displeasure with government , business , and civil actors in more informed ways . <p> In East Africa in particular , people are bracing themselves for the broadband revolution . Within 12 months , initiatives like Seacom and EasyCom are likely to be active in the region and will connect people in completely new ways . What will happen when the super-highways open their gates ? Will traffic flow in one direction or two ? Will East Africans become net consumers or producers of information ? <p> Last week , Kenya held its first " content " conference arranged by the national ICT Board . Public and private people had plenty to say about " local content " and why it mattered . What started as a technical discussion about connectivity quickly turned to issues of national pride , language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultures . While Kenyans clearly yearn to be part of the global community and consume information far beyond their borders , they also want to be heard , recognized , and contribute to global conversations . They want their news , their music , their issues , and their voices to find a place in the online universe . <p> Today , Swahili books online for example , number in the hundreds compared to the hundreds of millions of books in English available online . What message does this send to young people about the relative importance of their knowledge , language , and culture ? Fortunately , Google translation tools are beginning to address this challenge and launching search in Swahili is creating the right incentives to put more content online . But what else will it take to create symmetry between the number of people who speak a given language and content available to them ? <p> The good news is that there is no paucity of African content in the offline world . Africa is home to some of the worlds richest musical traditions , oral histories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news is that mobile phones are likely to be gateways to the internet in much of the continent . The challenge is how to migrate this wealth of content from the offline to the online world . If Africans are going to get online en masse , they need a reason to go there and they need to see themselves , their values , and their stories when looking through the online prism . With the availability of Google MapMaker in Africa , were already seeing that people are creating their own content and populating base maps with layers that are meaningful and useful to them . That is exciting . Whether its stories , pictures , or data on budgets and literacy rates , I hope we can give people a stake and a reason to get online and participate in the information society . <h> Thursday 11/20/2008 01:27:00 PM <p> With a new President and Congress , we have an unprecedented opportunity to transform our fossil fuel economy to one based largely on clean energy , while creating millions of jobs in the process . <p> Last month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. can dramatically scale up renewable energy , become smarter about how we use energy , and deploy millions of plug-in electric cars . Our energy team has continued crunching the numbers and just posted new data on job creation and cost savings on our knol . We 'll keep updating the information and encourage everyone to take a look and comment - and offer alternative approaches if you disagree . <p> Reaching the goals of Clean Energy 2030 will require a comprehensive effort by the new President and Congress . At a minimum , we believe it should include putting a price on carbon emissions , setting national energy efficiency and renewable energy goals , and modernizing our electricity grid . With the right policies , we can drive trillions of dollars of new investment in clean energy and create millions of new jobs . <p> Stimulating the economy and creating jobs will be the first item of business when the new President and Congress take office in January . We hope that clean energy will be front and center . In its last effort to address the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy , but much more needs to be done . Here are some ideas on how to advance clean energy as part of a stimulus package : <p> Get money flowing to renewable energy . Many wind and solar project developers cant take advantage of the renewable tax credits that were just extended . The continuing economic decline has wiped out profits in many companies - and the otherwise expected tax liability that credits offset . Congress should make changes , such as making the credits refundable , to make it possible for investors to get the value Congress intended . <p> Start building a smarter electricity grid . The last large energy bill passed in 2007 authorized , but did not fund , matching grants and demonstration programs to encourage investment in a " smart " electricity grid . These programs should be fully funded and expanded so more consumers have the opportunity to better monitor and control their electricity use and reduce their bills . A new Department of Energy ( DOE ) sponsored book explaining smart grid describes it as " the internet brought to our electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficient . The DOE has a Weatherization Assistance Program that enables low-income families to permanently reduce their energy bills by making their homes more energy efficient . On average , weatherization reduces households ' heating bills by about 30% . President-elect Obama adopted our proposal to weatherize one million low income homes per year for the next 10 years . Current federal weatherization funding supports barely 10% of that number . A roughly $3 billion appropriation would weatherize roughly one million homes . <p> Green the Government . The U.S. government is the largest consumer of electricity . Accordingly , federal departments and agencies should lead by example when it comes to stimulating the economy through expanded energy efficiency efforts and increased use of clean energy . In addition , the Congress and the President can provide support to State and local governments for efficiency and smart grid projects ; the purchase of renewable power ; and converting vehicle fleets to low-emission vehicles , particularly plug-in electric cars and trucks . Such concerted government action will speed the advent of a new era of energy security and domestic job creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and improve energy security . If you have ideas to share , join the discussion on the Clean Energy 2030 knol . <h> Wednesday 11/19/2008 10:46:00 AM <p> Early readers of the Google.org blog may recall us embarking on a film project portraying public health heroes working in the field to eradicate polio . Gone from the modern world , new cases of polio continue to afflict mostly children under age 3 in the poorest regions of just a few countries India , Nigeria , Afghanistan and Pakistan . When we first announced this project and the collaboration between Google.org and Vermilion Films , filming was underway primarily in India and Afghanistan , documenting the front lines of public health in some forgotten corners of our world . <p> David Heymann of the World Health Organization reminds us , " When you have n't seen a disease for quite a while , which is the case in the industrialized countries , you forget about the terrible disease that it really is . " Polio is such a disease , as it can ruin the lives of children even before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We 're proud to announce The Final Inch , a 38-minute film about the historic global effort to eradicate polio . Here , the story told is as much about the messengers as the message . You 'll meet Munzareen Fatima , one of the thousands of community " foot soldiers " across India working to sway reluctant families to vaccinate their children , and Dr. Ashfaq Bhat , who travels into the backwaters of India 's Ganges Basin by boat and foot to detect emerging cases of polio . Martha Mason and Mikail Davenport bring us into their lives and describe the paralyzing challenges of childhood polio , reminding us how endemic polio once was in the United States . <p> Filmed in high-definition ( HD ) in cinematic style wide open shots to give a strong sense of place The Final Inch captures their stories , and we hope it is both a tribute and an inspiration of hope . With a final push , this is a disease that can , and should , be eradicated finally . <p> The Final Inch will air nationally on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TheFinalInch.org , where you can view clips from the film and learn more about the people and the organizations tirelessly working on this global effort . You can also check out the film trailer here : <p> Update on 1/22 : The Final Inch received an Oscar nomination in the category of Best Documentary ( Short Film ) . Check out our post on the Google.org blog for more information . <p> Update on 3/31 : The Final Inch is coming to a TV screen near you ! You can tune into HBO2 on Wednesday April 1 at 8:00pm ( ET/PT ) to see our film . It will re-air on April 7 at 7:15pm and is available on HBO on demand . You can check out the full schedule on HBO 's website . <h> Tuesday 11/11/2008 01:14:00 PM <p> Like many Googlers , we 're fascinated by trends in online search queries . Whether you 're interested in U.S. elections , today 's hot trends , or each year 's Zeitgeist , patterns in Google search queries can be very informative . Last year , a small team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond simple trends and accurately model real-world phenomena using patterns in search queries . After meeting with the public health gurus on Google.org 's Predict and Prevent team , we decided to focus on outbreaks of infectious disease , which are responsible for millions of deaths around the world each year . You 've probably heard of one such disease : influenza , commonly known as " the flu , " which is responsible for up to 500,000 deaths worldwide each year . If you or your kids have ever caught the flu , you know just how awful it can be . <p> Our team found that certain aggregated search queries tend to be very common during flu season each year . We compared these aggregated queries against data provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , and we found that there 's a very close relationship between the frequency of these search queries and the number of people who are experiencing flu-like symptoms each week . As a result , if we tally each day 's flu-related search queries , we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this discovery , we have launched Google Flu Trends , where you can find up-to-date influenza-related activity estimates for each of the 50 states in the U.S. <p> The CDC does a great job of surveying real doctors and patients to accurately track the flu , so why bother with estimates from aggregated search queries ? It turns out that traditional flu surveillance systems take 1-2 weeks to collect and release surveillance data , but Google search queries can be automatically counted very quickly . By making our flu estimates available each day , Google Flu Trends may provide an early-warning system for outbreaks of influenza . <p> For epidemiologists , this is an exciting development , because early detection of a disease outbreak can reduce the number of people affected . If a new strain of influenza virus emerges under certain conditions , a pandemic could emerge and cause millions of deaths ( as happened , for example , in 1918 ) . Our up-to-date influenza estimates may enable public health officials and health professionals to better respond to seasonal epidemics and though we hope never to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Epidemiology and Prevention Branch of the Influenza Division at CDC throughout the 2007-2008 flu season , and together we saw that our search-based flu estimates had a consistently strong correlation with real CDC surveillance data . Our system is still very experimental , so anything is possible , but we 're hoping to see similar correlations in the coming year . <p> We could n't have created such good models without aggregating hundreds of billions of individual searches going back to 2003 . Of course , we 're keenly aware of the trust that users place in us and of our responsibility to protect their privacy . Flu Trends can never be used to identify individual users because we rely on anonymized , aggregated counts of how often certain search queries occur each week . The patterns we observe in the data are only meaningful across large populations of Google search users . <p> Flu season is here , so avoid becoming part of our statistics and get a flu shot ! And keep an eye on those graphs if you 're curious to see how the flu season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published an academic paper in Nature , the international journal of science , explaining the science and methodology behind Flu Trends . Check it out for more information . <h> 11/04/2008 11:07:00 AM <p> On September 12 2008 , Cecilia van Deventer , a safari booking agent living in Zambia , was flown to South Africa in critical condition . She died just two days later . By October 6 2008 , three more people had died : the paramedic who accompanied Cecilia to South Africa , the nurse who cared for her in Intensive Care , and the cleaner who cleaned her hospital room after her death . A fifth patient , a nurse who cared for the infected paramedic , is receiving anti-viral treatment . In all cases , people infected were exposed to infected blood and/or body fluids . <p> South Africa 's National Institute for Communicable Diseases ( NICD ) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( US-CDC ) quickly identified the infectious agent as an arenavirus similar to the one that causes Lassa Fever - a disease that affects 500 000 people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sequencing of the viral genome by Professor Ian Lipkin and colleagues at the Center for Infection and Immunity ( CII ) at Columbia University , it has been clearly shown that this is an arenavirus that has never been seen before . Google.org 's Predict and Prevent initiative recently announced a grant of $2.5 million to support CII 's work in pathogen discovery . This identification of a novel arenavirus not only represents an early success , but also demonstrates just why this work is so important . ' There is no doubt we are dealing with a newly emerged virus , ' said Dr. Janusz Paweska , head of the special pathology unit at the NICD in Johannesburg . As Professor Robert Swanepoel , also of the NICD , has pointed out , the virus is ' newly-discovered ' rather than new , and has probably been around in animal populations for some time before making a recent jump to humans . <p> Arenaviruses , normally transferred to humans through contact with the urine of their rodent hosts , can be classified into New and Old World viruses depending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectively . New World arenaviruses , including Junin , Machupo , Sabia and Guanarito , can cause viral hemorrhagic fever . This particular virus , classified as Old World due to its African origins , began as a flu-like illness , then caused diarrhea , pharyngitis and a rash before rapidly culminating in respiratory distress , neurological symptoms and circulatory collapse over a period of about 9-12 days . The virus has yet to receive a name . <p> Due to the swift action of the NICD , US-CDC and CII the outbreak is now described as contained . We commend their efforts !
