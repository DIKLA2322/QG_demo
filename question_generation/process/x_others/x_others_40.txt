@@13269014 @1869014/ <h> Tuesday 8/31/2010 05:29:00 PM <p> Here in the U.S. I often take for granted the ability to immediately find information on if I might have a cold versus the flu or what vaccinations are recommended prior to traveling abroad . Like a lot of Americans , I often consult health information on the Internet in addition to talking with a medical professional . This information makes me more informed about my own health and more confident in making healthy decisions . <p> In most parts of the world , however , quality information that would help people improve their health is not available online in local languages . In fact , a 2004 Lancet article ( . pdf ) described the lack of access to health information as a " major barrier to knowledge-based healthcare in developing countries . " The authors noted that " among currently available technologies , only the Internet has the potential to deliver universal access to up-to-date healthcare information . " <p> To tackle this issue , we 're introducing a new initiative called Health Speaks which aims to help increase the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are beginning pilot projects to support community-based , crowd-sourced translation of health information from English into Arabic , Hindi and Swahili.We encourage anyone with health knowledge who is bilingual in English and either Arabic , Hindi or Swahili to take part in the pilot projects for Health Speaks . We have chosen hundreds of good quality English language health articles from Wikipedia that we hope will be translated with the assistance of Google Translator Toolkit , made locally relevant , reviewed and then published to the corresponding local language Wikipedia site . To further show our commitment to this cause , we have funded the professional translation of a small subset of these articles . <p> We are additionally providing a donation incentive to encourage community translators to participate . For the first 60 days , we will donate 3 cents ( US ) for each English word translated to the Children 's Cancer Hospital Egypt 57357 , the Public Health Foundation of India and the African Medical and Research Foundation ( AMREF ) for the pilots in Arabic , Hindi and Swahili , respectively , up to $50,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends and neighbors access quality health information in a local language , while also supporting a local non-profit organization working in health or health education . <p> We will undoubtedly learn from these three pilots and iterate on our approach as we learn how best to engage volunteers and provide tools that allow for easy and accurate translation . We hope to one day expand the Health Speaks initiative to include high-quality health content from other publishers and other languages that suffer from a lack of health information online . <p> According to UNESCO , 90% of the content on the Internet exists in only 12 languages . Language should not be the barrier that denies millions of people worldwide the opportunity to improve their health with valuable health information . Please join us in the effort to break down part of that barrier . <p> Update on 10/15 @ 10AM : We are excited to extend the donation incentive period for all three pilots to December 15 , 2010 . However , registration for new participants will close , as planned , on October 31 , 2010 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far . At our events in Egypt , India , Kenya and Tanzania we heard from so many people about the effect quality health information can have in their communities . We 've also received a great deal of feedback on the pilot and , as expected , will iterate on how best to crowd-source the translation of the health information . In the meantime , we 've decided to extend the donation incentive period because we know many community members have begun translating articles , but have not had enough time to complete and publish them . We hope the additional time will allow community members to complete the great work they have started so their communities can benefit . <h> Monday 8/30/2010 03:25:00 PM <p> Google PowerMeter now offers personalized energy savings recommendations to help you save more energy and show off your savings .

August 19th marks the anniversary of the 2003 bombing of the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad , in which Sergio Vieira de Mello , the UNs Special Representative in Iraq , and 21 of his colleagues were killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Humanitarians often work in some of the least secure corners of the world . They face war , famine , disease and natural disasters . On this day , were honored to highlight all the work being done by our partners , and all organizations and individuals , who work to help global challenges . And we are reminded of how important it is to respond directly to the current flooding in Pakistan and the many humanitarian crises that continue today . <p> There are also many ways to have an impact on humanitarian crises from afar . In the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon Oil Rig explosion , for example , the Defenders of Wildlife ( and latest Google Earth Hero ) built the Gulf Oil Spill Recovery map to track restoration efforts from citizens , nonprofits and government agencies . <p> Humanitarian workers are deeply involved in solutions to the global challenges being addressed by the Millennium Development Goals . Recently the UN Secretary General issued a request for citizens around the world to become " Citizen Ambassadors , " giving people the opportunity to provide direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can participate : <p> Thanks again to all the organizations and individuals who help others . <h> Friday 8/13/2010 09:33:00 AM <p> Pakistan has been struck by the worst flooding in its recorded history . The latest estimate of the number of people affected by the flood exceeds 14 millionmore than the combined total of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami , the 2005 Kashmir earthquake and the 2010 Haiti earthquake . Critical infrastructure has been damaged over the last two weeks and clean water is in short supply . As monsoons approach , flooding is expected to worsen . <p> Our Crisis Response team has been working to use existing tools and build new ones to help the relief efforts . We just launched a page in Urdu and English where you can find information , resources and donation opportunities to help the victims of the floods . Were also donating $250,000 to international and local NGOs to immediately aid in relief efforts . Although we 've been able to provide satellite imagery for disasters in the past , cloud cover in Pakistan has prevented us from compiling useful imagery so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . <p> We 've already learned a lot about building useful tools from our previous efforts to help with disaster relief . Following the earthquake in Haiti , a small team of Googlers visited relief aid workers in Haiti to understand how we could further help . In observing and speaking with the relief aid workers , we learned that they needed up-to-date information about available resources ( such as which field hospitals have X-ray machines or orthopedic surgeons ) , their location and contact information . Coordination between various health and relief facilities that spring up in a disaster zone can be challenging . <p> Based on what we learned in Haiti , we 've been working to develop Resource Finder , a new tool to help disseminate updated information about which services various health facilities offer . It provides a map with editable records to help relief workers maintain up-to-date information on the services , doctors , equipment and beds available at neighboring health facilities so that they can efficiently arrange patient transfers . We normally would n't release the tool so quickly , but decided to make an early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Pakistan . This is the first time the tool is being launched during a disaster situation so well be working closely with NGOs to understand its usefulness and will iterate accordingly . <p> We 've also launched Person Finder in both Urdu and English for this disaster . This application allows individuals to check and post on the status of relatives or friends affected by a disaster . Fortunately , we 've heard that missing persons has not been as concerning an issue as it was during the earthquakes in Haiti and Chile , but well leave the application up regardless . <p> Responding to a disaster of this scale is a daunting task , but we can all do something to help . We will try to do our part and continue working with the many incredible NGOs to develop tools that help them work more effectively . <h> Thursday 8/12/2010 10:09:00 AM <p> I 've learned a lot as an intern with Google.orgs health efforts the last few months . Just this week I learned about a new collaboration between Google.org grantee HealthMap - the same group mentioned in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dengue Branch of the US Centers for Disease Prevention and Control ( CDC ) . Theyve created DengueMap to show recent reports of dengue around the world and regions where people are at risk to catch it . The reports on DengueMap are updated multiple times a day , keeping you up-to-date on where dengue is . <p> One week ago , I barely knew a thing about dengue . It turns out 2.5 billion people around the world are at risk of contracting dengue , and 50 to 100 million people get sick from it every year . Dengue is present in more than 100 countries , and dengue is on the rise in many parts of the world . This even includes the US . According to the CDC , there have been 28 cases where people caught dengue in Florida since 2009 . While this does n't  sound like a lot of cases , its somewhat alarming given that there were only a handful of cases ever recorded before 2009 . <p> Dengue thrives in both cities and rural areas of the tropics and subtropics and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The symptoms are similar to a severe flu , and can be quite painful . There is no cure and no vaccine . Fortunately , dengue rarely causes death , though severe complications , like dengue hemorrhagic fever , can be lethal . <p> The bottom line ? Be smart about protecting yourself from dengue . Know the areas where dengue is present ( DengueMap is helpful for this ) and wear bug spray . <p> Indeed , we believe our work in clean energy is good for business . We made the decision to become carbon neutral in 2007 . We are minimizing our energy consumption with some of the most energy efficient data centers in the world , lowering our energy costs . And we are purchasing carbon offsets for the emissions we cant eliminate . We also seek to power our facilities with renewable energy , like one of the largest corporate solar installations at our headquarters in Mountain View , CA . And were making investments in renewable energy , such as our $38.8 million investment in two North Dakota wind farms , and our recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year period , spurring real growth in the sector by giving the developer financial certainty to develop new projects . <p> As a technology company , we 've seen how the power of innovation can change the way we live our lives . Eric Schmidt said it best : " In Silicon Valley , it was the limitations of one technology or system that served as the drivers of change and led to the success of our industries here . AB32 provides a similar opportunity for new job creation in many sectors as business responds to the need for energy-efficient buildings , transportation and a growing portfolio of renewable energy resources . " <p> Were committed to finding the right solutions to a clean energy future and we hope Californias policies continue to lead the way . <h> Friday 8/06/2010 11:59:00 AM <p> According to the UN , the recent floods in Pakistan have affected over 4 million individuals - and the human toll continues to grow . Disease is an ever-increasing risk as relief agencies rush to the aid of those who have been hurt or displaced . <p> Googles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assist relief efforts in past disasters , including the Haiti earthquake and recent Gulf of Mexico oil spill . In Pakistan , however , the cloud cover over the impacted areas has inhibited our ability to make this valuable content available . The Crisis Response team is looking to collect and aggregate imagery and user generated KML , or other map data , with the goal of making this content more accessible to both crisis responders and the general public . Were hoping you can help . You can submit links to KML and map data via the following form . Well contact you if we are able to publish your content . <p> Further , we 've released a version of our Person Finder tool in Urdu . We realize many of the victims of this disaster lack any connectivity to the Internet , but remain hopeful that tools like this can assist the diaspora and general disaster community in collecting and dispersing information on the well-being of those impacted . <p> Your data might help relief efforts ; we appreciate you sharing it with the world .

" <h> 9/12/2007 08:39:00 AM <p> Posted by Kirsten Olsen <p> Since Google.org launched the RechargeIT initiative in June as part of our efforts to stop global warming , a lot has happened in the world of plug-in vehicles . Automakers have made key announcements about future plans for plug-ins . Our grantee , the Electric Power Research Institute ( EPRI ) , along with Natural Resources Defense Council ( NRDC ) , released a comprehensive assessment that found that widespread use of plug-in hybrids could dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions . The charge for electrified transportation is heating up , and we could n't be more excited . But consumers still ca n't buy plug-in vehicles and that 's a problem . It 's time for us to put some money where our mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Today , Google.org has issued a request for investment proposals ( RFP ) to the tune of $10 million in order to advance sustainable transportation solutions . We are inviting entrepreneurs and companies to show us their best ideas on how they can contribute to this important cause . We need catalytic investments to support technologies , products and services that are critical to accelerating plug-in vehicle commercialization . That is why we have structured this RFP to offer investment dollars to for-profit companies to promote social and environmental change . The severity of global warming requires solutions from NGOs , governments , individuals and ( very importantly ) the private sector . We have already made $1 million in grants to a group of outstanding non-profit organizations , and want to expand our impact by spurring innovation in the private sector . While $10 million is a fraction of the total investment needed to transform our transportation sector , we hope this RFP will help catalyze a broader response . We need the automakers to bring these cars to market , but plug-in vehicles also need an entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this type of open call for proposals is not the usual model for investment , but we wanted to use a process that was open to new ideas and new entrants .

We welcome and expect to receive submissions from a wide variety of companies -- from cutting edge battery technologies to innovative service businesses and from companies of all sizes . We also encourage participants from all over the world to submit proposals . This is a global challenge , and it will take all of us to solve it . <p> This open RFP process is a new approach to mission-focused investing , and we 're interested to see what we can learn from it , both in terms of opportunities and gaps that exist in this space today , as well as ways that we can improve on this solicitation process for future investments . Our focus on learning is the primary reason we decided to narrow this first RFP to investments in private companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We will continue to make grants as part of RechargeIT and other programs , but we 're excited today to announce our first foray into investments.To learn more , read the RFP . <h> Monday 9/10/2007 11:11:00 AM <p> Posted by Daniel Conrad , Senior Business Analyst , Google <p> Joseph Tackie is the CEO of Meaty Foods Limited , a high-end butcher in Ghana .

He told me about the progress of his business one year since his graduation . <p> DC : I heard that you quintupled sales in one month after winning seed capital from BBB last year . How on earth ? <p> JT : See , the difficulty of our environment is that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect you to have already made it , to have already become successful before they invest .

And our sales quintupled in just one month . <p> Three weeks ago I got my certification from the Ghanaian Standards Board . It cost a lot of money , and this is the type of thing that nobody will finance because they see you as a start-up . Now I can sell to any supermarket in Ghana.When you are a start-up , none of the banks wants to do business with you . But with a little success , now they are chasing you to do business with them . <p> DC : What are your future plans for your business ? <p> JT : First , we are developing our outlets . We have one store now , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We also have a request to set up a similar processing facility in Mali . They have lots of beef in Mali but no high-end processing . <p> DC : What did you learn from the BBB program ? <p> JT : What really made the difference with the program was the networking . Because the program is organized by entrepreneurs it is very practical . They are like role models . Your anxieties are things they have experienced , so you can share with them . <p> Working with entrepreneurs breaks down the fears and anxieties . Issues to do with risks are minimized . You are exposed to success . A lot of people are afraid to venture because of the losses they have dealt with . But working with other entrepreneurs enables you to look forward . The obstacles will always be there , but you will be equipped to go around them . <p> There have been a lot of people saying foreign aid is bad . But this is different . It is like you are teaching me to fish . This BBB program empowered me.

After the January 12th earthquake in Haiti , a team of Googlers worked with the U.S. Department of State to quickly create a site that helped people who were affected by the disaster . The site was used heavily after the Chile earthquake in February and put in action again in April after the Qinghai earthquake in China and in August for the Pakistan floods . <p> In addition to opening our product for developers , we 've decided its now time to turn off our Google Person Finder instances for Haiti , Chile , China , and Pakistan .

Their most common request was for visualizations that enable easy comparison of flu levels across regions , so that differences in the trend of the season could be easily identified . We now publish the flu levels of all countries and regions on Google Public Data Explorer which provides this feature and much more . Also , as part of our annual model update for the Northern Hemisphere , were refreshing our models in 13 countries and adding new regional estimates for the Netherlands , Belgium , Canada , Switzerland , and Spain . <p> Its important to note that the flu level is a normalized number indicating how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a place . Zero means business as usual . Eight means flu activity is unusually high for that country or region . So , you cant use these visualizations to say there was more flu in one place than in another , but you can know whether the situation deviated more from normalcy in one location than in another . <p> Let 's look at some of the ways these new visualizations allow us to compare flu activity across the globe : <p> Has the flu season started in Western Europe ? There was a bit of activity in Germany and Austria at the beginning of October . Otherwise , there is not much flu in that region as of this week . <p> Let 's look at the data on a map . On the chart below , each bubble has a size proportional to the flu level for November 9 , 2008 ( a minus sign indicates less flu activity than is usual ) . The flu season has n't  started anywhere . Hit the " Play " button to see how the flu season develops first in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the northern and southern hemispheres . <p> Click on " Explore data " in any one of the charts above to go to Public Data Explorer and start exploring ! <h> Thursday 11/11/2010 12:16:00 AM <p> We know that in times of crisis , it 's especially important for you to find the crucial information you 're looking forand find it fast . Today , in 13 countries , well begin displaying some combination of special search results for searches around poison control , suicide and common emergency numbers that point to emergency information . <p> This effort started last year when I received an email from a mother in the U.S. who had trouble finding the phone number for the poison control hotline after her daughter accidentally ingested something potentially poisonous ( fortunately , her daughter was fine ) . As a result , people in the U.S. performing various searches including " poison control " began to see a special result displaying the national phone number for the American Association of Poison Control Centers last fall . <p> Example of the poison control result in Spain <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we heard from Googlers whose lives had been affected by suicide and who thought that suicide prevention could be another case for a special search result . In April we began prominently displaying the number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at the top of the results page for certain search queries in the U.S. Since then , our friends at the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline have reported a 9 percent increase in legitimate calls to its hotline . <p> Example of the suicide prevention result in the UK <p> So , following positive feedback from consumers and our hotline partners , we decided to expand the poison control and suicide prevention special search results beyond the U.S. Each of these 13 countries will see one or more of these results : Australia , Belgium , France , Germany , Hungary , Italy , Netherlands , New Zealand , Norway , Spain , Sweden , Switzerland and the United Kingdom . We looked for hotlines that are available nationally and 24/7 and we hope to add additional countries in the future . <p> We 're also introducing a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , medical and police emergencies . We want to make this information easier to find for residents as well as travelers , especially as some countries have different numbers for different emergencies . <p> Example of the emergency number result in France <p> An emergency is stressful enough . We hope this small step helps connect people with the information they need immediately .
