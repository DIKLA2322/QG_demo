Early unconfirmed case reports
See also: Epidemiological tracing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
Some medical and environmental analyses in Italy, France and the United States suggest that the virus may have spread for several weeks before December 2019. For its part, a World Health Organization report noted, "These findings are unconfirmed, the methods used are not standardized, and serological tests may have non-specific signals." The World Health Organization urged further investigation of these potential early events.

December
Main Entry: 2019 Coronavirus disease Wuhan outbreak ยง 2019
In December, the first pandemic strain of Newcastle pneumonia, "China Wuhan original virus strain 19A", was introduced.

Post hoc epidemiological investigations pointed to the earliest known case symptoms occurring on December 1, 2019. According to the post hoc recollection of the outpatient physician at the Wuhan City Ufologic Hospital, on December 12, 2019, the hospital saw a 69-year-old male trader at the Wuhan City Huainan Seafood Market who had first appeared with respiratory symptoms, but the fever clinic at this small hospital was unable to confirm these abnormal cases, and after advising the patient to undergo a CT examination to no avail, the outpatient physician had to advise him to go to another better-equipped hospital, a referral time, there was some delay in the discovery of the outbreak. The post hoc study by Huang Chaolin and other scholars said that at the very beginning of the epidemic, the local CDC had concentrated several patients in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital for isolation and collection of samples and data, of which the earliest data samples had been one taken on December 16, 2019, and sent for testing one after another in the process of attempting treatment. It was not until after the doctors in the emergency department of Wuhan Central Hospital had treated the 65-year-old patient suspected of possible community-acquired pneumonia [Note 1] with various antibiotics that remained ineffective that they finally decided to send the alveolar lavage fluid samples to a third-party testing organization, Guangzhou Weifang Genetics, for testing based on second-generation high-throughput sequencing (NGS) technology so as to try to identify the actual pathogen. Guangzhou Micro Far Genetics in Huangpu, Guangzhou, the first known external laboratory to perform preliminary analysis of the novel coronavirus pathogen, received the sample by courier on December 24 and raised the alarm by finding the SARS coronavirus with approximately 94.5% similarity in the automated mNGS pathogenic microbial interpretation results on December 26.

This unexplained pneumonia was first identified and reported by Dr. Jixian Zhang in the Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine on December 26, 2019, and was suspected to be an infectious disease.

A paper titled "New coronavirus has spread in France at the end of December 2019" was published on May 3, 2020 in the medical journal International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents. Researchers selected 14 intensive care unit cases of influenza illness (ILI) between Dec. 2, 2019, and Jan. 16, 2020, for re-testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 nucleic acid from April 6 to 9 and found a positive sample from a 42-year-old man. The lack of association with China and the absence of a history of foreign travel prior to the onset of the case suggested that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 had spread in France in late December 2019.

On December 27, 2019, Guangzhou Micro Far Genetics finally assembled a near-complete genome sequence of the unknown virus and shared the data with the Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. Later, after making a more detailed comparison and analysis, it was found that the virus was not identical to all known genomic information and might be a novel virus similar to Bat SARS-like coronavirus (BSCV). This data was later submitted to the Global Influenza Data Sharing Initiative website by the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences on Jan. 11, and the analysis is the earliest dated sample in the database.

On December 30, 2019, the Medical Administration and Medical Management Division of the Wuhan Health and Health Commission, began to send emergency notifications to hospitals at all levels in Wuhan and issued two documents setting out measures for the rescue and treatment of pneumonia of unknown origin [Note 2] when diagnosed. The document flowed out of the health care system in the evening and was widely circulated on the Internet. In the evening, doctors such as Li Wenliang, Liu Wen, and Xielinka disclosed the news related to the outbreak early in an internal WeChat group to provide reference for the hospital's medical staff. Wuhan Central Hospital sent a sample to the Beijing Boao Medical Laboratory on December 27. The laboratory sent the test report back to the hospital on December 30, which listed "SARS coronavirus" (SARS coronavirus) as one of the "high confidence" positive results. Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital, circulated the test report within the hospital at 17:48 using WeChat to post the news "7 cases of SARS were confirmed at South China Fruit and Seafood Market" and photos of the test report in a group of classmates.

On December 31, 2019, the Wuhan CDC confirmed to the media that the document was true and issued an information circular [Note 3] to begin informing the public about the cases, stating that it was checking what kind of pneumonia it was. On the other hand, the Wuhan Health and Health Commission published the "Information Bulletin of the Wuhan Health and Health Commission on the Current Pneumonia Epidemic in the City", stating that 27 cases had been identified. Both the WHO office in China and the government of the People's Republic of China indicated that they had also informed WHO headquarters of the situation on the same day [Note 4], and that a large number of cases had visited the South China Seafood Market in Wuhan hospitals in mid to late December [Note 5]. On the same day, Taiwan's Agency for Disease Control learned of the suspected SARS outbreak in China through the local media and sent an email to the WHO International Health Regulations Contact Window requesting further information on the outbreak. The email was sent to the WHO International Health Regulations Contact Window requesting further information on the outbreak of atypical pneumonia, mentioning "atypical pneumonia", "patients have been treated in isolation", and confirming the outbreak with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention in mainland China. Mainland China responded in the evening that the diagnosis was confirmed and informed that experts had been sent to Wuhan to investigate, pointing out that 27 cases of pneumonia had recently been found there, seven of which were in critical condition and had been treated in isolation, with two cases improving. The clinical manifestations provided in the diagnosis, the main symptoms have for fever, a few patients with respiratory distress, showing double lung infiltrative lesions, most of the cases for Wuhan City, Jianghan District, South China Seafood City operators, has not yet found obvious human-to-human transmission phenomenon and health care workers infected. Taiwan on the same day began to direct flights from Wuhan to Taiwan for the entry quarantine.
