Oakland Digital 's BRIDGEGOOD hiring platform pairs early stage creatives ( designers , photographers , illustrators ) with business owners and nonprofits that need design or marketing expertise . Up to eight students can apply for the chance to tackle the project . <p> To date , Oakland Digital has worked with 4,500 entrepreneurs and Bay Area students , contributing more than $3.6 million to the local economy . By sponsoring these opportunities , Oakland Digital gives students a paycheck , a chance to try out their skills in the real world , and the opportunity to develop strong portfolios ... all while helping their community thrive . @qwx162836 <p> Google.org 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure grant , state-of-the-art technology devices , Googler developer volunteer hours , and the use of Google 's San Francisco coworking space for ongoing collaboration .

@@13268908 @1868908/ <h> Tuesday 6/28/2011 07:00:00 AM <p> At Google , were committed to using technology to solve one of the greatest challenges we face as a country : building a clean energy future . That 's why we 've worked hard to be carbon neutral as a company , launched our renewable energy cheaper than coal initiative and have invested in several clean energy companies and projects around the world . <p> But what if we knew the value of innovation in clean energy technologies ? How much could new technologies contribute to our economic growth , enhance our energy security or reduce greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions ? Robust data can help us understand these important questions , and the role innovation in clean energy could play in addressing our future economic , security and climate challenges . <p> Through Google.org , our energy team set out to answer some of these questions . Using McKinseys Low Carbon Economics Tool ( LCET ) , we assessed the long-term economic impacts for the U.S. assuming breakthroughs were made in several different clean energy technologies , like wind , geothermal and electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interlinked models that estimates the potential economic and technology implications of various policy and technology assumptions . <p> The analysis is based on a model and includes assumptions and conclusions that Google.org developed , so it is n't a prediction of the future . Weve decided to make the analysis and associated data available everywhere because we believe it could provide a new perspective on the economic value of public and private investment in energy innovation . Here are just some of the most compelling findings : <p> Energy innovation pays off big : We compared " business as usual " ( BAU ) to scenarios with breakthroughs in clean energy technologies . On top of those , we layered a series of possible clean energy policies ( more details in the report ) . We found that by 2030 , when compared to BAU , breakthroughs could help the U.S. : <p> Reduce U.S. total carbon emissions by 13% in 2030 ( 21% with Clean Policy ) <p> Speed matters and delay is costly : Our model found a mere five year delay ( 2010-2015 ) in accelerating technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggregate 1.2-1.4 million net unrealized jobs and 8-28 more gigatons of potential GHG emissions by 2050 . <p> Policy and innovation can enhance each other : Combining clean energy policies with technological breakthroughs increased the economic , security and pollution benefits for either innovation or policy alone . Take GHG emissions : the model showed that combining policy and innovation led to 59% GHG reductions by 2050 ( vs. 2005 levels ) , while maintaining economic growth . <p> This analysis assumed that breakthroughs in clean energy happened and that policies were put in place , and then tried to understand the impact . The data here allows us to imagine a world in which the U.S. captures the potential benefits of some clean energy technologies : economic growth , job generation and a reduction in harmful emissions . We have n't developed the roadmap , and getting there will take the right mix of policies , sustained investment in technological innovation by public and private institutions and mobilization of the private sectors entrepreneurial energies . We hope this analysis encourages further discussion and debate on these important issues .
@@13268910 @1868910/ <h> Friday 1/07/2011 05:29:00 PM <p> Sudan is preparing to vote on January 9 to decide if the South will become independent from the North . The referendum is part of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed in 2005 ending the Civil War , which lasted 22 years and led to the deaths of an estimated 2 million people . Analysts fear the possibility of renewed violence . <p> Sudan is a huge country ( 2.5 million km2 ) , with an estimated population of 44 million people , but its poorly mapped . Without basic geospatial information , its difficult for humanitarian agencies and first responders to monitor and evaluate the risks and current needs , target their efforts , and mobilize proper resources . At times like these , it is critical to have good maps on roads , settlements , voting stations , hospitals , buildings and other services - with both local and official names - to generate better , faster responses . <p> If you have knowledge of Southern Sudan , an interest in mapping , and some free time , we encourage you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maker and Sudan Vote Monitor , you have the opportunity to take concrete action by improving the map , helping to monitor and report human rights violations in near-real time and providing insight into the socio-political climate prevalent in the country and region . <p> Global Call for Action:Together let 's build a better map of Southern Sudan . Your local knowledge and mapping contributions of schools , hospitals , and landmarks will be extremely useful to the humanitarian community to quickly build a picture of the situation , especially in these areas of interest . <p> Items that you can map : <p> Towns and town names ( Arabic and local names especially ) <p> Roads ( in-town roads as well ) and trails <p> Displaced persons camps <p> Cultural landmarks <p> Geographic landmarks <p> Schools <p> Orphanages , shelters etc . <p> Hospitals <p> Community centers <p> Border crossing points <p> Nomadic camps <p> Markets and large cattle gathering points <p> This is an opportunity to utilize the power of community engagement through mapping .
