September 28, 2020 - The number of deaths from 2019 coronavirus disease around the world exceeds 1 million. The United States, India and Brazil, the three countries with the worst outbreaks, account for nearly half of the deaths. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described the death toll as unimaginably high and a very tragic milestone, and outside analysis believes that the figure must be lower than the actual total number of deaths, because many of the deceased have never been tested for the virus, and cannot exclude that some countries may have concealed the actual number. The World Health Organization earlier warned that before the vaccine could be widely used, the number of deaths from the disease could be as high as 2 million. In addition, WHO announced that it will provide more than 100 million new coronavirus rapid test agents to low- and middle-income countries to increase the detection rate.
