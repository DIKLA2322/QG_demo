@@13269035 @1869035/ <h> Wednesday 5/20/2009 12:01:00 AM <p> Earlier this year I blogged about energy information and a tool our engineers developed called Google PowerMeter , a Google gadget that can show consumers their personal electricity consumption right on a home computer . Our software relies on " smart meters " ( or other metering devices ) as a data source . Over the past several months we 've been looking to partner with utilities that are installing ( or have already installed ) this equipment in their customers ' homes . We 're energized by our very first Google PowerMeter partners : <p> Our initial partners include utilities with millions of customers as well as smaller ones . They are rural and urban , privately held and municipally run . Some are in the United States , others in Canada and India . They all have one thing in common a desire to serve their customers by providing access to detailed information that helps save energy and money . For now , Google PowerMeter is only available to a limited group of customers , but we plan to expand our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading the charge to make the electricity grid smarter and we look forward to working with them and others . <p> In addition to utilities , we 're also seeking partnerships with companies that can enable the implementation of our software . Our first such partner is Itron , a leading meter and data management company that serves over 8,000 utilities and is helping some of their customers , including San Diego Gas &amp; Electric , integrate with Google PowerMeter . If you 're a utility or company with a smart meter project that might be interested in plugging in to our efforts , visit our website for more information . <h> 5/13/2009 03:00:00 PM <p> As we blogged last summer , there are lots of experiments running on Google web search all over the world . Today we 've started a temporary experiment that some people might find interesting : we 're researching how Google users search the Internet when they or someone they know is feeling sick . <p> Understanding how people search when they 're feeling sick is an important problem to solve , as it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggregated search data to detect influenza epidemics . Statistics gathered in this experiment may also help Google deliver more relevant search results in the future . For example , someone who searches for arthritis pain to understand why an aging parent is experiencing joint pain might want to learn about nearby health facilities and potential treatments , whereas somebody who searches for arthritis pain because she is doing a research project might want results about how common arthritis is and what its risk factors are . Rather than make educated guesses about how many users are searching because they 're sick , we 're running this experiment to collect real statistics . This is not a permanent change , but a short-term experiment . A small percentage of random health-related searches will trigger the poll question . <p> For example , at the bottom of the search results for headache , some users will see a survey which asks whether they were searching because they or someone they know has a headache : <p> Similarly , if you happen to search for ibuprofen , a common anti-inflammatory drug , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you or somebody you know is taking ibuprofen : <p> Data collected in this survey will be aggregated across thousands of users . Survey responses will be stored together with the original search query , but will not be associated with email addresses or other personally identifiable information . Survey data will not be used for advertising it will only be used to help Google improve health-related search results and to help refine public health trends based on aggregated search queries , much like Google Flu Trends .

Their Field Guide to Humanitarian Mapping was produced " to help humanitarian organisations to make use of mapping methods using Geographic Information Systems ( GIS ) and related technologies " . You can download the first edition for free ( 3.2MB PDF ) . <p> While the free field guide is designed to help organizations doing emergency work , it is relevant to many other organizations , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like GPS technologies for collecting data , free &amp; open-source GIS software such as MapWindow for processing and analyzing data , and Google Earth and Google Maps for visualization and display . <p> Early last year , MapAction published a briefing paper ( 1MB PDF ) on the use of Google Earth in the humanitarian sector . Since then , we 've added several new features , like imagery acquisition dates and historical imagery , touring , ocean , and free GPS data import , all of which help users to visualize , share and explore their places and data in new and exciting ways . <p> Another great new resource is A Nonprofit 's Introduction to Google 's Online Mapping Tools , recently posted on TechSoup by Chris Peters and Mano Marks . It provides excellent advice on how organizations that have data to display can effectively use Google Maps and Google Earth for outreach and advocacy . <h> Wednesday 5/06/2009 03:07:00 PM <p> The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act , signed by President Obama in February , includes tens of billions of dollars in federal stimulus funding for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to rebuild our energy system and make it cleaner and more efficient . It 's also an opportunity to become " smarter " about the way we all use energy . <p> Getting smart about energy starts with empowering consumers and businesses with information and tools to make better energy choices . That 's why we submitted comments today with the Department of Energy , asking them to put consumers first as they develop one of the more promising elements of the ARRA -- a $4.5 billion grant program for " smart " grid investments . We also asked the DOE to ensure the program contributes to President Obama 's goal of funding the installation of 40 million smart electricity meters in American homes . You can read our comments here . <p> The advent of smart meters , the Internet and a myriad of other information technologies means that our interaction with electricity can be dramatically redefined . Instead of receiving a monthly bill in the mail , for example , we can receive information on electricity use in real time ; instead of turning on the furnace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can automate these systems or even control them remotely . We can even aggregate energy savings from appliances and electronic equipment from thousands of homes to avoid the need to build new power plants . <p> Using the stimulus to invest in the electricity grid can help accelerate this transformation , while in the process creating jobs and helping to diversify our energy supply . Most importantly , these investments can help consumers and businesses save energy and money . We feel it 's important for the country not to miss this opportunity .
