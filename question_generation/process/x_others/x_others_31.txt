Which sounds great , but if our country is , as some say , " the most generous , " we should ask ourselves a few questions : why are there growing numbers in line at food banks ? When will American people give as much per capita for international aid as the Netherlands , for one ? <p> Researchers like me live for tough questions like these . So now that the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana Universityand Google are tackling the issue of charitable giving and the proportion that is focused on the needs of the poor in the U.S. and on international aid , I expect my job to be very interesting for a long time to come . <p> Were off to a great start . Yesterday we released the first Center on Philanthropy/Google studyPDF which used data from Center household surveys about giving . Google executive Sheryl Sandberg authored an April Wall Street Journal op-ed titled " The Charity Gap " ( subscription ) using some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study , we use data about the types of charities that people ( households ) give to and estimate the share that is focused on the needs of the poor . For example , we found that about 8 percent of charitable dollars given by households goes for programs " helping to meet peoples basic needs . " We estimate another 23 percent supports poverty-alleviation activities at other types of charities -- for example , employment skills training at neighborhood centers . There is still more work to be done to illuminate corporate giving , which is allocated differently than household contributions . In fact , one of the fastest growing areas for corporate donors is international aid , an area where Google.org has made significant commitments . <p> And we are n't done yet . The household surveys ask about why people give , so we can look at motivations , too . In one interesting contrast , we found in early analysis of another survey that nearly 6 in 10 people said they want to help people in need -- but nowhere near 60 percent of the dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shelter . Stay tuned for more from this combined research effort . <p> The Census Bureau reports 37 million people in the U.S. live in poverty . Half of the worlds population lives on less than $2 per day . Anyone can respond with charitable dollars . Research like this can help us understand where our money goes and what it helps to accomplish . <h> Friday 7/20/2007 09:27:00 PM <p> Posted by Irene Taylor Brodsky , Founder , Vermilion Films <p> I 'm en route home from a three day shoot in Lattimore , North Carolina with a woman who contracted polio in 1948 and lives in an iron lung . <p> In 1994 , Martha Mason wrote a book called " Breath " about her life , which is how I found her . Her memoir not only brings to life the polio epidemics of the 1940s ; her descriptions take you inside the cocoon of steel she has lived in for nearly 60 years . The iron lung encases all but her neck and face . Inside the lung lies Martha 's inert body , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mechanical bellows sucking air in and out of the air-tight chamber . The six foot-long chamber runs on electricity and gives Martha her every breath . Something as banal as a power outage or a tripped circuit could end her life within four or five minutes . <p> And yet it never has . Everything about Martha tells you she is a survivor . She became paralyzed with polio just days after her only brother , Gaston , died from it . Her parents knelt down and made a deal with God in 1948 : If He would spare their only remaining child , they would dedicate their lives to caring for her . And care for her they did for 50 more years , until their own deaths . Today , Martha still lives in the house where she first got sick , a simple farmhouse just down the street from the Baptist Church in her town of 300 people . Back in the 60s , Martha spent four years at Wake Forest University ( where she graduated Valedictorian ) , otherwise , she 's pretty content to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nearest Wal-Mart or gas station , is 13 miles away . <p> Hillary Clinton 's saying is , " it takes a village , " and in Martha 's case , Lattimore has helped keep her going all these years . " It 's been a pretty good ride , " she kept telling me in her characteristic good humor . She has three round-the-clock caregivers , one of whom she taught to read 20 years ago . Martha gets a visitor just about every day , and a local friend set her up with a voice-recognition computer which she uses " to travel the world . " ( She also reads four newspapers a day . ) The Baptist Church tapes its service every Sunday for her . The doctors make house calls . Even though polio seems all but disappeared in this country , in this tiny American town , they have n't forgotten it . How can they ? They have Martha . <h> Monday 7/02/2007 03:15:00 PM <p> Posted by Alix Zwane , Researcher , google.org <p> I first got to know google.org while on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a joint Harvard/UC Berkeley study on cost-effective water investments in developing countries . The Millennium Development Goals call for reducing by half the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water . This goal was adopted in large part because clean water was seen as critical to fighting diarrheal disease , which kills 2 million children annually . Together with my teammates Edward Miguel , Jessica Leino , and Michael Kremer , I 've been undertaking field-based research to assess the effectiveness of water quality improvements in western Kenya . There is compelling evidence that provision of piped water and sanitation can substantially reduce child mortality . However , it 's expensive , which has led many poor countries to instead provide community-level water infrastructure , such as wells . But somewhat surprisingly , we actually know very little about how well these kind of investments do at reducing the diarrheal disease burden . Our research is intended to provide rigorous evidence on this question . <p> Our approach measures the impact of spring protection , a process that clears and seals off the source of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeping from the ground . Naturally-occurring springs are an important source of drinking water in western Kenya , but they 're vulnerable to contamination when left unprotected , particularly from human and animal fecal matter . A locally-based non-governmental development organization ( NGO ) is protecting 200 springs in Busia , Kenya over a four-year span , and they 've kindly let us tag along . <p> Taking E. coli as our fecal indicator bacteria , our preliminary analysis suggests that spring protection leads to large improvements in source water quality . Not all of these improvements translate to improved water quality at home perhaps 70% but recontamination during transport and storage may be less of a concern than is sometimes claimed . We 're still trying to figure out whether these water quality gains have led to child health improvements ; either way , our findings will help us understand the benefits of achieving the water Millennium Development Goal . <p> I should also mention that I 'm now a full-time Googler funny how life happens ! so stay tuned here for future research updates .

As a woman , I have n't been allowed into mosques , but I 've stayed determined to somehow get my crew inside of one to record the beautiful , haunting , beckoning sounds heard five times a day throughout Muslim neighborhoods all over India . These calls mingle with bad static , reverb , or a low hum over low-quality outdoor loudspeakers . A crude transmission , perhaps , but an unforgettable sound . <p> That day in Meerut , my camera man and sound man were in the neighborhood mosque while I waited outside , intently listening to what our camera was recording inside . A crowd started to gather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but because of our jeep and the two women left alone in it . We were a curiosity . A diminutive man with a wide smile ambled up to our car , " May I kindly know , Madam , what you are doing here in our neighborhood today ? " He was paraplegic , with a steel walker around the front of his five-foot-tall body like a miniature Colosseum . His walker was very worn out , and was at least three or four inches too short for him in a way that made his back lean over and his smile look up . I explained our film . He keenly listened to every word and replied simply , " My name is Muhammad Gulzar , and I am a polio survivor . Madam , may I help you ? " <p> I 'm not a superstitious person , but I could n't help but feel as I drove away that day with his phone number in my pocket that all of my earlier failed attempts to film a call to prayer ( the first time we did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masked the sounds ... ) had but one purpose : To lead me to this mosque , on this corner , to this polio survivor named Gulzar . <p> An educated and unemployed Muslim , Gulzar volunteered with our crew over the next two days and eventually opened his doors to us to film him . After two weeks of filming the effort to eradicate the disease in India , it was there in Gulzar 's home that we finally saw polio up close and personal . He was 24 years old , but in the privacy of his home he had to crawl like a baby . In public , he wore calipers on his legs , and his hands bore the calluses of someone who carries his own weight every day on a frame of steel . His family ( one of the most loving and supportive I 've known ) clearly makes every accommodation for Gulzar , but the realities of public life can be cruel . There are no handicap ramps into buildings , no adjustable lifts onto buses no way , I realize , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of India 's best and brightest , but how , I wonder , can Gulzar possibly get to a job ? Mobility is his greatest challenge . <h> 7/02/2007 09:49:00 AM <p> Posted by Greg Miller , Managing Director , google.org <p> Last fall our team spent time talking with philanthropies and other organizations with long histories of successful interventions in the field of global public health . Considering many ideas , we talked about what it will take to finally eradicate polio in the developing world , and the role that philanthropy can play . Many of our parents remember what it was like to have polio in this country , and a few people in the States still reside in iron lungs . These generations are advancing , and it 's important that we not forget how horrible the crippling of polio can be to those who are at risk today . <p> The community of nations , health workers and funders have come very close to wiping polio off the map : in 1988 over 350,000 cases of polio were reported ; last year that number had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under age 3 in just a few countries India , Nigeria , Afghanistan and Pakistan . Several donor organizations have been raising funds for polio eradication for decades , such as the Rotarians who have raised and given more than $600 million for polio eradication .

We 're hopeful this film will re-energize the group of dedicated donors and health workers to bring this campaign over the finish line .

Experts were asked to assess what solutions provided the biggest bang for our buck in areas that spanned politics , economics , and the environment . Google.org adviser Lant Pritchett authored one of the ten " challenge papers " on education , and I did one on water and sanitation . The results were controversial not so much because of what was ranked at the top - HIV/AIDS - but because of what was at the bottom - climate change . <p> On Sunday May 25 , the Danish Prime Minister opened Copenhagen Consensus 2008 , the sequel .

This work , based on results from field work in Kenya , was funded by one of the first Google.org grants and shows that novel water treatment products ( one of which is marketed under the name WaterGuard ) for home use can be cost-effective ways to reduce diarrhea , a major cause of child mortality . In contrast to the research that Alix and I refer to , Whittington 's challenge paper is more pessimistic about whether water and sanitation interventions are the best use of scarce resources that are supposed to improve the lives of the poor . They base this claim mostly on the expense of the technologies they consider ( wells , piped water and sewerage ) . <p> In our review , Alix and I argue that a key reason that water services are not working for the poor is the same reason why other public services are failing the poor : a lack of accountability between providers , policymakers , and consumers that has resulted in bad management and governance .

It 's been a great car and , after more than 100,000 miles , it has a lot of memories : a ski trip to Lake Tahoe through a blizzard , driving down the I5 to Los Angeles , driving across the entire country and then back ! However , over the last few years I started to feel guilty about the how much gas my car managed to guzzle . The official stats claimed 19 miles-per-gallon on the highway , but they must have been driving slower than I do because I never saw that sort of mileage . So , I was excited when the government approved the " Cash for Clunkers " program ! <p> I talked it over with my wife , and we decided it was time to upgrade to a more environmentally friendly car . We looked around , and decided to get a Toyota Prius . After checking out the Cash for Clunkers website , I figured out that because the Prius is rated at 50 mpg , well more than 10 mpg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were eligible for a $4,500 trade-in value through the program .

We found a participating dealer nearby and headed over to trade in our clunker . <p> After a quick test drive and some effective negotiations , we struck a deal and bought the new car . As always , there was quite a bit of paperwork involved , including a few extra pages for the " Cash for Clunkers " program . ( Then again , $4,500 is certainly worth a couple of pages of paperwork . ) After signing on the dotted line , the car was ours . <p> Just today President Barack Obama signed a bill extending funding for this incredibly popular program , which burned through its $1 billion budget in just one week . It 's not often you can get something you want , feel like you 're doing something good for the planet , and get $4,500 for doing it .

But a recent study issued by McKinsey &amp; Co. details just how compelling an opportunity we are missing . McKinsey predicts that an annual investment of roughly $50 billion over the next 10 years would cut energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth $1.2 trillion ! The energy savings would be equal to taking the entire U.S. passenger fleet of cars and trucks off the road . <p> Such efficiency gains are possible only if we overcome some major hurdles . For instance , most people have no idea how much energy we use in our homes on a daily basis or which of our appliances or devices are consuming the most energy . That 's one of the reasons that we created Google PowerMeter , a software gadget that shows users detailed information on their home electricity consumption . Studies show that when people have access to this kind information they reduce their energy use by up to 15% . Greater savings are possible if people use the information to buy a more efficient refrigerator or air conditioner , insulate their home , or take advantage of off-peak electricity rates . <p> The McKinsey report acknowledges that energy efficiency alone wo n't solve our energy and climate challenges . We must continue to put major resources into low-carbon sources of energy like renewable energy , and the federal economic stimulus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a good start .

We must monitor this important mechanism of disease emergence if we want to catch the next pandemic , for the sake of our health and the health of generations to come .
