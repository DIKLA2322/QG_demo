If he were to tour our electrical grid , he would recognize that too . As former Secretary of State George Shultz says , in energy " the past must not be prologue . " Can we reinvent our energy system in only ten years ? I think we can -- but we need to have a clear mission , we need to aim high , and we need substantial and sustained R&amp;D funding . <p> This funding , coupled with tax incentives , loan guarantees , and other market mechanisms , is needed to drive innovation across the entire R&amp;D pipeline -- from research , to development , to demonstration , to deployment , to full-scale commercialization . At Google we like to say , " from lightbulbs to lightbulbs " -- from the initial idea to real products . However you phrase it , investment is needed across that entire pipeline , especially from the government in the early stages where the energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generate technological breakthroughs . <p> Since 1980 U.S. federal investment in energy R&amp;D has dropped by 58 percent . Back then , 10 percent of the total government R&amp;D investment was in energy . Today , the percentage has shrunk to only two percent . Recent signs in Washington are definitely positive . Earlier this year , President Obama added over $5.7 billion in 2-year stimulus funding for energy research , development , and demonstration . But this is n't enough , and it 's not sustained . We 're still on a 2-lane innovation road , not a superhighway -- and the road we 're currently on is headed for a big cliff . Unless something changes , we 're going to lose this significant funding after next year . <p> President Obama has called for $150 billion over 10 years for energy R&amp;D . Some experts go even further -- Professors Dan Kammen and Gregory Nemet at UC Berkeley propose that annual energy R&amp;D levels on the order of $30 billion will be necessary to address the climate challenge . And I was delighted to see recently that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund breakthrough ideas -- has made its first set of grants of $151 million for 37 projects . This is a great start , but it is only a start . We all need do our part to help convince our leaders in Washington to follow up on this down payment with substantial and sustained investment . <h> Tuesday 11/10/2009 09:46:00 AM <p> This year , it 's especially important to have clear information on what you can do to prepare for the flu season . With this in mind , we are happy to share a new feature for the U.S. which allows you to more easily find locations near you for getting both the seasonal and H1N1 flu vaccine . After expandingGoogle Flu Trends to a total of 20 countries and 38 languages , allowing more people to see near real-time estimates of flu activity , we began brainstorming with the U.S. Department for Health and Human Services ( HHS ) , their flu.gov collaborators and the American Lung Association on the flu shot finder and other ways Google can be helpful to people this flu season . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ www.google.com/flushot . The same tool will also be available shortly on www.flu.gov and the American Lung Association websites . It 's important to note that this project is just beginning and we have not yet received information about flu shot clinics for many locations . In addition , many locations that are shown are currently out of stock . We launched this service now in order to help disseminate information about locations where vaccines are available , and also to make more vaccine providers aware of the project so that they can contribute . <p> Especially given slower than expected vaccine production , we think it 's important to bring together flu shot information in a coherent manner . We 've been working with HHS , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) and state and local health agencies to gather information on flu vaccine locations across the country , particularly for the H1N1 flu vaccine ( both the nasal-spray vaccine and the shot ) . At the moment we have data for locations of flu vaccine directly from 20 states and counting . We are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all 50 states ; today , you 'll find results from chains such as Walgreens , CVS and PDX participants , such as Kmart , Duane Reade , WinnDixie and Giant Eagle . <p> Of course you should still call flu vaccine providers ahead of time to find out more about availability and eligibility for the two vaccines . <p> We hope to continue providing you with relevant information to help keep you and your loved ones healthy .
