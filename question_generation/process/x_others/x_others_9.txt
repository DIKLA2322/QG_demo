Aid organizations have been hard at work and cities are starting to show signs of recovery , but the damage is beyond imagination and there are still thousands of people at shelters grappling with daily challenges . As a native of Sendai city , I 'm still speechless seeing the destruction and damage that has been done to the places I love and care about . <p> Weve been looking for ways we can assist in the relief efforts using Googles map-related tools . A few days after the quake , we published updated satellite imagery of northeast Japan in Google Maps and Google Earth , which illustrated the massive scale of devastation in the affected areas . <p> Today , we 've published imagery of the Sendai region at even higher resolution , which we collected on Sunday and Monday . The new Sendai imagery , along with satellite imagery from throughout the area , is now live in the base imagery layer of Google Earth and will soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collecting updated images and publishing them as soon as they are ready . <p> We hope our effort to deliver up-to-date imagery provides the relief organizations and volunteers working around the clock with the data they need to better understand the current conditions on the ground .

Last night members of the Google.org team were delighted to celebrate the inaugural class of Global Health Corps Fellows as they assembled at the Stanford University School of Medicine before embarking on their year-long placements in Malawi , Tanzania , Rwanda , New Jersey , and Boston . The Fellows met for the first time during a two-week course to prepare them for their upcoming assignments . <p> The Global Health Corps concept was a product of some exciting brainstorming during the aids2031 conference hosted by Google.org in March 2008 . GHC 's 6-person leadership team includes Barbara Bush as President , and two Googlers , Charlie Hale and Andrew Bentley . " This has been an amazing collaborative effort . We 've had an incredible amount of support from a number of partners , and are confident this first class of fellows will have a tremendous impact , " says Charlie Hale . <p> The organization strives to improve the quality of health services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduates from Africa and America with health-focused non-profit organizations . <p> Angie Bengtson from Minnesota and Mweya Clement from Tanzania are a duo that will begin their one year assignment with SACIDs ( Southern African Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance ) in August .

The fellows will promote cultural awareness while improving healthcare systems in need . <p> We salute the new class of fellows and wish them luck in their exciting new adventure !

But a recent study issued by McKinsey &amp; Co. details just how compelling an opportunity we are missing . McKinsey predicts that an annual investment of roughly $50 billion over the next 10 years would cut energy demand by 23% and yield savings to the U.S. economy worth $1.2 trillion ! The energy savings would be equal to taking the entire U.S. passenger fleet of cars and trucks off the road . <p> Such efficiency gains are possible only if we overcome some major hurdles . For instance , most people have no idea how much energy we use in our homes on a daily basis or which of our appliances or devices are consuming the most energy . That 's one of the reasons that we created Google PowerMeter , a software gadget that shows users detailed information on their home electricity consumption . Studies show that when people have access to this kind information they reduce their energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if people use the information to buy a more efficient refrigerator or air conditioner , insulate their home , or take advantage of off-peak electricity rates . <p> The McKinsey report acknowledges that energy efficiency alone wo n't solve our energy and climate challenges . We must continue to put major resources into low-carbon sources of energy like renewable energy , and the federal economic stimulus , with its tens of billions of targeted dollars and incentives , is a good start . But the McKinsey findings are a wake up call . As we enact more comprehensive energy policies , energy efficiency -- and giving people the information , tools and incentives to take advantage of it -- should be front and center .
