@@13269112 @1869112/ <h> Wednesday 10/15/2008 01:45:00 PM <p> Today is Blog Action Day , an annual event that rallies blogs around the world to post about a common cause . This year 's issue up for discussion is poverty , so we wanted to take a look at the relationship between access to information and social and economic development . The right information at the right time in the hands of people has enormous power . As someone who works for Google , I see evidence of this everyday as people search and find information they need to create knowledge , grow their business , or access essential services . But that applies primarily to the rich world , where economies are built on knowledge and presume access to information . What about the poor and developing countries where people are offline more than online ? How do they benefit from the power of information ? <p> In much of Sub-Saharan Africa , for example , rates of economic growth over the last decade have exceeded 5% every year . Despite this trend , poverty in many countries has remained constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate was 48% in 1981 . According to the Kenya Poverty and Inequality Assessment released by the World Bank this year , 17 million Kenyans or 47% of the population were unable to meet the costs of food sufficient to fulfill basic daily caloric requirements . The vast majority of these people live in rural areas and have even less access to the information that impacts their daily life . Data on water quality , education and health budgets , and agricultural prices are nearly impossible to access . <p> Despite hundreds of millions of dollars spent each year on providing basic public services like primary education , health , water , and sanitation to poor communities , poverty in much of Sub-Saharan Africa persists . Where does this money go , who gets it , and what are the results of the resources invested ? That 's where we find a big black hole of information and a lack of basic accountability . How do inputs ( dollars spent ) turn into outputs ( schools , clinics , and wells ) , and , more importantly , how do outputs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , etc . ) ? <p> We simply do n't  know the answers to most of these basic questions . But what if we could ? What if a mother could find out how much money was budgeted for her daughter 's school each year and how much of it was received ? What if she and other parents could report how often teachers are absent from school or whether health clinics have the medicines they are supposed to carry ? What if citizens could access and report on basic information to determine value for money as tax payers ? <p> The work of SODNET in Kenya is illustrative . They are developing a simple budget-tracking tool that allows citizens to track the allocation , use , and ultimate result of government funds earmarked for infrastructure projects in their districts . The tool is intended to create transparency in the use of tax revenues and answer the simple question : Are resources reaching their intended beneficiaries ? Using tools like maps , they are able to overlay information that begins to tell a compelling story . <p> Google.orgs role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to support , catalyze , and widely disseminate this kind of information to public , private , and civil society stakeholders that can use it to see more clearly what 's working , what 's broken and what are potential solutions . Leveraging platforms like Google Earth and Google Maps can help organizations disseminate their content widely and let people see and understand what was once invisible . Once information is visible , widely known , and easy to understand , we are betting that governments and citizens will pay more attention to leakages in the service delivery pipeline and feel empowered to propose solutions . <p> You ca n't change what you cant see . The power to know plus the power to act on what you know is the surest way to achieve positive social change from the bottom up . And when we consider the magnitude of resources invested in delivering public services each year , a 10% improvement globally would exceed the value of all foreign aid . We believe that is a bet worth making .
@@13269113 @1869113/ <h> Thursday 12/18/2008 10:40:00 AM <p> There 's a great deal of talk about the high cost of oil and the billions of dollars that the US and other oil-importing nations spend each year to buy oil . As part of the Google.org Geo Challenge Grants Program , Rocky Mountain Institute ( RMI ) has created a map of US oil imports by country since 1973 . By clicking on the green light to play , you can see the countries supplying oil to the U.S. ( either in terms of barrels or dollar value ) and how our imports have changed over the last 35 years.The thicker the line in the map , the more oil produced or imported . While this map highlights data on United States oil imports , the picture is similar for every oil-importing country in the world . <p> The map highlights 5 eras of oil consumption , from the oil shocks of the 1970s to the price collapse in the 1980s to recent events including Hurricane Katrina and gas approaching $5 per gallon before retreating rapidly recently . ( You can see these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the RMI website . ) One interesting time period is from 1982 to 1985 , when low prices caused oil imports from the Middle East to decline to very low levels . <p> The map also looks at potential oil from offshore drilling and exploration of the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge ( ANWR ) . The screenshot below illustrates the impact of off-shore drilling . With the map zoomed or drilled 3-5 levels down and centered near Alabama ( and the map pushpin that represents offshore ) , check out the very thin line that shows the potential peak production of 220,000 barrels per day.The lines represent estimates of production in 20-30 years , and even with this very long timeline , the amount of oil that could be generated from offshore drilling is miniscule compared to our oil needs today . <p> Both Google and RMI are working hard to help create a future where we are not reliant on daily imports of millions of barrels of oil that pollute our atmosphere and risk our national security . <p> Today , along with the Brookings Institution , RMI is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identify solutions to break Americas dependence on oil , with Google in attendance . In 2004 , RMIs Chief Scientist , Chairman and Co-founder Amory Lovins and a team of RMI collaborators drafted Winning the Oil Endgame ( PDF of the book ) - a roadmap for the United States to get completely off oil by 2050 . <p> Google.orgs RechargeIT initiative is driving toward the commercialization of plug-in vehicles that can wean the US off gasoline . In our Clean Energy 2030 Plan we show that increasing conventional automobile mileage , deploying millions of plug-in hybrids and accelerating the turnover of the fleet would reduce oil consumption by 51% by 2030 . That decrease would have an even larger effect on oil imports because we produce about one-third of our oil in the US . Google and RMI have worked together on a number of projects including RMIs Smart GarageCharrette , a summit to identify the barriers and breakthroughs needed to electrify the U.S. auto fleet . <p> While oil prices have declined rapidly over the past five months , most people expect oil prices to remain high into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop in oil prices reduces the need to act , President-Elect Barack Obama responded that we go from " shock to trance " and as a result " never make any progress .

We 've had a busy year with our clean energy initiatives . Take look at our redesigned green website and this new video from the Google green team to learn more about the priorities were pursuing : <p> As we look back on 2010 , we wanted to highlight what we 've been working on this year to help build a more sustainable futurefor Google , and the world . <p> Greening our operations . We already have the most energy efficient data centers in the world , and use renewable energy whenever possible . This year we created a subsidiary , Google Energy LLC , to enable us to purchase renewable energy on the wholesale power markets and to help spur development in the sector . <p> 20-year green power purchase . Our FERC authority enabled Google Energy LLC to enter a 20-year green Power Purchase Agreement ( PPA ) in July to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation at NextEras Story County II facility in Iowa ( read more about how the deal is structured ) . By purchasing so much energy for so long , were giving the developer financial certainty to build additional clean energy projects . <p> Developing green products and tools . Just a few weeks ago , during the the U.N . Climate Change Conference in sunny Cancun , Mexico , we launched Google Earth Engine , a new Google Labs product . Google Earth Engine is a technology platform that makes an unprecedented catalog of imagery and data available online in one place for the first time . It enables global-scale monitoring and measurement of changes in the earths environment . Were particularly excited about the initial use of Google Earth Engine to support efforts to stop global deforestation . We 've also been busy this year incorporating green features into our productslike Google Maps biking directions and adding Carbon Disclosure Project ratings into Google Finance . <p> Investing in a clean energy future . To date , Google has invested over $100 million in clean energy . Google.org has already invested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal R&amp;D on renewable energy technologies ( RE&lt;C ) , substantially growing our engineering team . And this year , Google began making project investments that offer a solid financial return , and could have a transformational impact on the renewable energy sector . <p> North Dakota wind farms . In May , we invested $38.8 million in two North Dakota wind farms that generate 169.5MW , enough to power 55,000 homes . It was our first project investment , and uses some of the latest wind turbine technology and control systems to provide one of the lowest-cost sources of renewable energy to the local grid . <p> Offshore wind transmission . In October , we made a development stage investment in a project to build a backbone transmission line off the Mid-Atlantic coast . The project will put in place strong , secure transmission , removing a major barrier to scaling up offshore wind . When finished , the 350-mile line will connect up to 6,000MW of offshore wind energyenough to serve approximately 1.9 million households ! <p> Its been a busy year at Google , and we believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we head into the new year , we look forward to continuing our work to find and support innovative clean energy solutions . <h> 12/20/2010 12:55:00 PM <p> In September we announcedHealth Speaks , an initiative to make more quality health information available in local languages on the Internet . We began by launching three pilots for which people crowd-sourced translation of English Wikipedia health articles into Arabic , Hindi and Swahili . <p> After an inspiring 3.5 months , these pilots have come to a close . Health Speaks communities translated , reviewed and published 266 new health articles ( 177 in Arabic , 79 in Hindi and 10 in Swahili ) . My colleague , Dr. Joanne Stevens , and I met hundreds of enthusiastic volunteers , and heard powerful stories about the importance of local language health information . We 've also learned invaluable lessons about providing tools that allow for community coordination and easy and accurate translation . <p> While we iterate on our future approach for crowd-sourcing the translation of health content , there are still many ways to contribute to the goals of Health Speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health information to consider one or more of the following : <p> Lastly , we would like to give a special mention to the many Wikipedians who worked with us by training others and providing help with Wikipedia , as well as to our top contributors for each pilot . <p> Were already seeing evidence of the impact of our volunteers hard work . For example , three reproductive health-related articles in Arabic have been viewed over 20,000 times . Articles from the Health Speaks pilots ( including the professionally translated articles commissioned by Google.org ) have been viewed over 145,000 times . We think its a great first step towards making important health information accessible online in all languages . <h> Friday 12/17/2010 09:58:00 AM <p> The past couple of years have been a challenging stretch for charitable organizations as giving tends to decline during economic downturns when the need is highest .

Google Earth Engine is a new technology platform that puts an unprecedented amount of satellite imagery and datacurrent and historicalonline for the first time . It enables global-scale monitoring and measurement of changes in the earths environment . The platform will enable scientists to use our extensive computing infrastructurethe Google " cloud " to analyze this imagery . Last year , we demonstrated an early prototype . Since then , we have developed the platform , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Earth Engine to implement their applications . <p> Why is this important ? The images of our planet from space contain a wealth of information , ready to be extracted and applied to many societal challenges . Scientific analysis can transform these images from a mere set of pixels into useful informationsuch as the locations and extent of global forests , detecting how our forests are changing over time , directing resources for disaster response or water resource mapping . <p> The challenge has been to cope with the massive scale of satellite imagery archives , and the computational resources required for their analysis . As a result , many of these images have never been seen , much less analyzed . Now , scientists will be able to build applications to mine this treasure trove of data on Google Earth Engine , providing several advantages : <p> Landsat satellite data archives over the last 25 years for most of the developing world available online , ready to be used together with other datasets including MODIS . And we will soon offer a complete global archive of Landsat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructure . By running analyses across thousands of computers , for example , unthinkable tasks are now possible for the first time . <p> New features that will make analysis easier , such as tools that pre-process the images to remove clouds and haze . <p> Collaboration and standardization by creating a common platform for global data analysis . <p> Google Earth Engine can be used for a wide range of applicationsfrom mapping water resources to ecosystem services to deforestation . Its part of our broader effort at Google to build a more sustainable future . Were particularly excited about an initial use of Google Earth Engine to support development of systems to monitor , report and verify ( MRV ) efforts to stop global deforestation . <p> Deforestation releases a significant amount of carbon into the atmosphere , accounting for 12-18% of annual greenhouse gas emissions . The world loses 32 million acres of tropical forests every year , an area the size of Greece . The United Nations has proposed a framework known as REDD ( Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries ) that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forests . Reaching an agreement on early development of REDD is a key agenda item here in Cancun . <p> Today , we announced that we are donating 10 million CPU-hours a year over the next two years on the Google Earth Engine platform , to strengthen the capacity of developing world nations to track the state of their forests , in preparation for REDD . For the least developed nations , Google Earth Engine will provide critical access to terabytes of data , a growing set of analytical tools and our high-performance processing capabilities . We believe Google Earth Engine will bring transparency and more certainty to global efforts to stop deforestation . <p> Weve been working with several partners to fully develop this platform . In particular , the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation has been a key strategic and funding partner . The Moore Foundation has also committed over $12 million dollars through its Environmental Conservation Program to projects that support the development of Google Earth Engine . The Moore Foundations Environment Program finances practical , enduring solutions to environmental challenges and works to improve the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coastal marine ecosystems to create working land and seascapes that support resilient and productive ecosystems for current and future generations . Theyve funded the U.S. Geological Survey to scale their infrastructure and accelerate bringing historic Landsat data off tape , and online , through Google Earth Engine . <p> This animation shows the breadth and depth of the Landsat archive that has been uploaded into Google Earth Engine to date . We are grateful to the USGS for their ongoing technical collaboration . <p> Support from the Moore Foundation includes funding for several scientists to develop and integrate their desktop software to work online with the data available in Google Earth Engine . Those scientists -- Greg Asner of the Carnegie Institution for Science and Carlos Souza of Imazon -- are also key partners , along with Matt Hansen of the Geographic Information Science Center at South Dakota State University . All are at the cutting edge of forest monitoring in support of climate science . <p> In collaboration with Matt Hansen and CONAFOR , Mexicos National Forestry Commission , we 've produced a forest cover and water map of Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to date . The map required 15,000 hours of computation , but was completed in less than a day on Google Earth Engine , using 1,000 computers over more than 53,000 Landsat scenes ( 1984-2010 ) . CONAFOR provided National Forest Inventory ground-sampled data to calibrate and validate the algorithm . <p> A forest cover and water map of Mexico ( southern portion , including the Yucatan peninsula ) , produced in collaboration with scientist Matthew Hansen and CONAFOR . <p> We hope that Google Earth Engine will be an important tool to help institutions around the world manage forests more wisely . As we fully develop the platform , we hope more scientists will use new Earth Engine API to integrate their applications onlinefor deforestation , disease mitigation , disaster response , water resource mapping and other beneficial uses . If you 're interested in partnering with us , we want to hear from youvisit our website ! We look forward to seeing what 's possible when scientists , governments , NGOs , universities , and others gain access to data and computing resources to collaborate online to help protect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Moore Foundation , Google Earth Engines Landsat archive , and the Congo Basin Water Map have been added to the post . <h> Wednesday 12/01/2010 10:00:00 AM <p> Occasionally , we invite distinguished guests to contribute to our blogs and were very happy to have Wangari Maathai share her perspective here . In collaboration with Wangari Maathais Green Belt Movement and several other partners , the Google Earth Outreach team has created several narrated tours on the topic of climate change in preparation for the UNFCCCs COP16 Climate Summit 2010 in Cancun , Mexico . Fly underwater to learn about the effects of ocean acidification on sea life with Oceana . Zoom around Mexican mangroves in 3D and learn about the importance of this biodiverse habitat ... and what must be done to protect it for future generations . Visit **42;763;TOOLONG to experience these tours . -Ed . <p> Ask most people what trees mean to them and the first thing that comes to mind is the tree outside their bedroom window or the forest where they played as a child . Trees do occupy a powerful place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect our worlds trees is not based on sentiment . There is a vital interdependency between communities and the trees they rely on for survival . Trees are our watersheds , protectors of the natural environment , and sources of food . Remove the trees from the equation and the community feels the impact . <p> I came to this realization in the 1970s in Kenya . I was talking to women in my community about their problems : hunger , access to water , poverty , wood fuel . I saw a link between their needs and the condition of the land and thought , " Why not plant trees to address these issues ? " Trees hold the soil to the ground so that we can grow food in it , they protect watersheds and facilitate harvesting of rain water , fruits trees supplement food and trees give us domestic energy and wood with which to build our shelters . So while still working at the University of Nairobi , I established a tree nursery in my backyard , planted seven trees at a public park and founded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities , to build their capacity to restore Africa 's forests and put an end to the problems that deforestation and other forms of environmental degradation cause . As a result of this idea , more than 40 million trees have been planted to restore the environment and improve the lives of the people who are linked to the land . <p> When we were offered a unique opportunity to partner with the Google Earth Outreach team on a project using new Google Earth technology to visualize trees in 3D , we were thrilled . For accuracy and integrity we worked very closely with Google , advising them on the modeling of unique African trees like the broad-leaved Croton , the Nile tulip tree and the East African Cordia . These tree models illustrate the biodiversity in our tree planting sites , especially in the forests , and how we carefully select trees that are indigenous and sustainable to the natural surroundings . <p> Broad-leaved Croton , the Nile tulip tree and the East African Cordia ( from left to right ) <p> We then used data from real planting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth and create 3D visualizations . Now , for the first time in Google Earth , people from all over the world will be able to virtually visit these planting sites , explore the 3D trees and connect with the work that we are doing . <p> Green Belt Movement planting site in 3D on Google Earth <p> Tree planting is a simple activity with tangible results , and anyone can participate . It helps people come together to address common problems and work collectively towards community improvement and sustainability . I hope that seeing our beautiful tree planting sites in 3D on Google Earth will be a source of inspiration for people to engage , plant trees and organize planting activities in their own communities . Taking charge of our lives and the environment around us can help ensure a lasting legacy and healthy future for our children .
