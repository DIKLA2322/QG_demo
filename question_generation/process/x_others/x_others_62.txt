Meanwhile , people living in parts of the world without wired infrastructure rely on wireless broadband for their last mile connection . As more people go online and the number of wireless devices grows , so does the need for spectrum . <p> There is available spectrum out there -- but it can be hard to find if you do n't know where to look . One way we 're trying to help researchers and other stakeholders identify available spectrum is through dynamic spectrum sharing . Spectrum sharing allows devices to use spectrum when it is not in use by someone else simply by checking a data base . We 're in the process ( with several others ) of becoming a certified database administrator for a band of spectrum called the TV white spaces . <p> Today , we 've reached a milestone in the certification process : our database is beginning a public trial with the FCC .

The trial site also allows anyone to find out how much TV white spaces spectrum is available at any location , such as your home or office . <p> Google Earth visualization of available TV whitespace spectrum . <p> The completion of the trial will bring us all one step closer to freeing up more spectrum , which in turn will help the industry bring new wireless technologies to market and enable people to get wireless Internet access when and where they need it .
@@13269106 @1869106/ <p> Indeed , we believe our work in clean energy is good for business . We made the decision to become carbon neutral in 2007 . We are minimizing our energy consumption with some of the most energy efficient data centers in the world , lowering our energy costs . And we are purchasing carbon offsets for the emissions we cant eliminate . We also seek to power our facilities with renewable energy , like one of the largest corporate solar installations at our headquarters in Mountain View , CA . And were making investments in renewable energy , such as our $38.8 million investment in two North Dakota wind farms , and our recent agreement to purchase 114MW of wind energy over a 20 year period , spurring real growth in the sector by giving the developer financial certainty to develop new projects . <p> As a technology company , we 've seen how the power of innovation can change the way we live our lives . Eric Schmidt said it best : " In Silicon Valley , it was the limitations of one technology or system that served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our industries here . AB32 provides a similar opportunity for new job creation in many sectors as business responds to the need for energy-efficient buildings , transportation and a growing portfolio of renewable energy resources . " <p> Were committed to finding the right solutions to a clean energy future and we hope Californias policies continue to lead the way .

The forum , now in its fourth year , is organized by Koji Omi , former Minster of Finance and Science and Technology of Japan . The dual theme of the forum was " returning to harmony with nature " and " innovation " . It examined the linked challenges of climate , energy , and water , together with impacts and contributions of the digital , biotechnology , and nanotechnology revolutions . <p> The new Japanese Prime Minister , Yasuo Fukuda , kicked off the meeting by stressing the need to make the transition to a sustainable society through science and technology . There was remarkable consensus in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest challenges we face . Science and technology helped humanity alter the face of the planet at an unprecedented rate , and human activities are now threatening the geo-bio-chemical systems on which all life on earth is based . Science and technology must now be deployed to help regain balance . <p> The most amazing side of the meeting is how " mainstream " this message has suddenly become . As a sustainable development professional , I have gone to environmentalist meetings with pretty much the same message for two decades . Then , however , I was preaching to the converted . Suddenly , mainstream leaders from government , business , and academia are now singing the same song . Al Gores film awakened an environmental consciousness in the general population , and it seems we have finally passed a tipping point ! To me that is great news . <p> There was debate on how to best balance the allocation of resources for climate change mitigation ( i.e. greenhouse gas emission reduction ) and for climate change adaptation ( i.e. increasing societys resilience in dealing with a changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who have contributed the least to global warming but will bear the brunt of its impact - particularly in Africa . There , farmers throughout the continent will face catastrophic crop losses due to increased droughts , people in the highlands of countries such as Ethiopia will be introduced to malaria and East African coastal countries will face sea level rise that can cost up to 10% of GDP . <p> I was there to give my perspective on water-related challenges for science and technology , and although only a handful of the participants shared my area of expertise , I was pleasantly surprised to see this meeting put in its final statement that , " Water , whether it is for drinking or for agriculture , is now one of the most pressing global issues we must deal with . " <p> Japan will chair and host next years G8 summit , and Koji Omi fully intends to have the conclusions of this year 's Science and Technology in Society Forum influence next year 's debate . In a world where small steps count , this meeting was a small step in the right direction .
