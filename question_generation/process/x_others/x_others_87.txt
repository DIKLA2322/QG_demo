So it was n't surprising that when we considered areas to support with our philanthropic efforts , helping entrepreneurs in developing countries rose to the top . This past January we launched an initiative to Fuel the Growth of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises ( SMEs ) . SMEs in developed countries account for half of GDP and two-thirds of jobs , but they 're largely absent in developing countries . We wanted to explore how we could help drive capital to these high-growth businesses . At the same time , we launched a parallel effort to increase access to vital information in poor countries . This effort , known as Inform and Empower , aims to help improve the quality of public services by organizing critical information and making it accessible to all ( sound familiar ? ) . <p> We still strongly believe that growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Google 's ten organizing principles is , " it 's best to do one thing really , really well . " As we evaluated our efforts this past year , it became clear that given Google.org 's unique strengths - including the ability to tap Google engineers to build and link better pathways to information - we could have a greater impact on the lives of the poor by focusing our efforts on Inform and Empower . As a result , we 're putting our SME initiative on the back burner . We 'll continue to support the grants and investments that we 've already committed under the initiative . We have observed and learned from many others addressing the challenges of financing SMEs -- many of whom are seeing significant strong results -- and we hope they continue with great success . At this time , however , we will not fund new efforts in the SME space . <p> Google remains committed to its philanthropic goal : using information and technology to take on some of the world 's greatest challenges . We continue to draw upon resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as outlined by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in their 2004 letter to investors . We 've had a strong year of giving since the launch of our initiatives . We know that the global financial crisis is disproportionately affecting the poor and plan to increase our overall giving in 2009 . <h> Friday 12/19/2008 11:53:00 AM <p> In early 2008 , Google.org announced its initiatives to the world and made clear how the company would leverage its people , money , and creativity to address some of the worlds most pressing and difficult problems . Among them were climate change/renewable energy , global poverty , and emerging threats . <p> In Africa , one of our initiatives is focused on leveraging the power of information ( or the right to know ) to increase transparency , accountability , and ultimately the delivery and quality of public services . " You ca n't change what you cant see " is one of our mantras , and our job is to shine light in dark places and help people decipher the black box of public service delivery . What is working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to plug holes in a leaky pipeline of service delivery ? <p> Much of the initiative is about unlocking quasi-public information . One of my colleagues calls it DBHD ( database hugging disorder ) . Why is so much " public " information not accessible ( ie government budgets , service level indicators , population data ) and sitting on servers in London , New York , and Geneva but not accessible to citizens , media , and even planners in Africa countries ? This clearly needs to change . <p> What is less intuitive , however , is that there is so much information , knowledge , and wisdom within Africa that is not making its way to politicians , planners , and policy makers who make decisions about Africa . We often hear that teachers , nurses , and civil servants do not show-up for work across the continent and this is a primary contributor to the poor quality of public services . Do we bother asking why absenteeism is such a problem ? Ask teachers , nurses , or administrators and they will tell you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was adopted in many African countries more than a decade ago , classroom sizes have doubled if not tripled while teacher salaries , instructional materials , and training have hardly changed at all . Government dispensaries are rarely stocked with medications that people come to purchase so why bother staffing clinics ? <p> Last month in rural Uganda , I saw an example of how information gathered from students is helping a local NGO address pupil absenteeism in a very targeted way . The primary school has created a student-led club that investigates why students are missing school and why they drop-out . After all , fellow students face similar challenges and know much about their peers . It turns out that most students dropping out are girls ; early pregnancy and lack of finances to purchase school uniforms are leading causes of student absenteeism . <p> With this information in hand , the Kabarole Research Centre is working with student leaders to plant a community garden to raise money to buy uniforms for needy students , and both are working with community leaders and parents committees to raise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Several young girls have returned to school after giving birth , and school administrators are more aware of what needs to happen to reduce student attrition . <p> And so its not just about delivering information to people so they can make better decisions . Its also about listening to people to make sure donors , planners , and government officials make better decisions . Using student leaders to understand better why their peers are missing school may seem obvious , but such approaches are pretty rare in top-down systems . Better information is certainly not a panacea but its a necessary condition to make better decisions based on evidence rather than anecdote . <h> Thursday 12/18/2008 10:40:00 AM <p> There 's a great deal of talk about the high cost of oil and the billions of dollars that the US and other oil-importing nations spend each year to buy oil . As part of the Google.org Geo Challenge Grants Program , Rocky Mountain Institute ( RMI ) has created a map of US oil imports by country since 1973 . By clicking on the green light to play , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either in terms of barrels or dollar value ) and how our imports have changed over the last 35 years.The thicker the line in the map , the more oil produced or imported . While this map highlights data on United States oil imports , the picture is similar for every oil-importing country in the world . <p> The map highlights 5 eras of oil consumption , from the oil shocks of the 1970s to the price collapse in the 1980s to recent events including Hurricane Katrina and gas approaching $5 per gallon before retreating rapidly recently . ( You can see these selections by clicking on the buttons below the map on the RMI website . ) One interesting time period is from 1982 to 1985 , when low prices caused oil imports from the Middle East to decline to very low levels . <p> The map also looks at potential oil from offshore drilling and exploration of the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge ( ANWR ) . The screenshot below illustrates the impact of off-shore drilling . With the map zoomed or drilled 3-5 levels down and centered near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , check out the very thin line that shows the potential peak production of 220,000 barrels per day.The lines represent estimates of production in 20-30 years , and even with this very long timeline , the amount of oil that could be generated from offshore drilling is miniscule compared to our oil needs today . <p> Both Google and RMI are working hard to help create a future where we are not reliant on daily imports of millions of barrels of oil that pollute our atmosphere and risk our national security . <p> Today , along with the Brookings Institution , RMI is hosting " The Oil Solutions Initiative " a summit to identify solutions to break Americas dependence on oil , with Google in attendance . In 2004 , RMIs Chief Scientist , Chairman and Co-founder Amory Lovins and a team of RMI collaborators drafted Winning the Oil Endgame ( PDF of the book ) - a roadmap for the United States to get completely off oil by 2050 . <p> Google.orgs RechargeIT initiative is driving toward the commercialization of plug-in vehicles that can wean the US off gasoline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing conventional automobile mileage , deploying millions of plug-in hybrids and accelerating the turnover of the fleet would reduce oil consumption by 51% by 2030 . That decrease would have an even larger effect on oil imports because we produce about one-third of our oil in the US . Google and RMI have worked together on a number of projects including RMIs Smart GarageCharrette , a summit to identify the barriers and breakthroughs needed to electrify the U.S. auto fleet . <p> While oil prices have declined rapidly over the past five months , most people expect oil prices to remain high into the near future . When asked whether or not the drop in oil prices reduces the need to act , President-Elect Barack Obama responded that we go from " shock to trance " and as a result " never make any progress .

We are currently accepting applications for the December 22 , 2008 deadline . <h> Wednesday 12/10/2008 11:48:00 PM <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an India made up of thousands of " little Republics " where people meet their needs through self-reliance . Today , panchayats are responsible for implementing development programs . They often create positive change at the grassroots level , but their success stories are n't  as well known as they should be . For example in Kerala , a panchayat that was committed to education made sure the entire village was completely literate . And in the Thar district of Rajasthan , a panchayat converted the area into a tourist destination , increasing the incomes of inhabitants . <p> Today we 're launching the Google.org Gram Panchayat Puraskar ( GGPP ) to celebrate innovative panchayats and encourage more innovation in local governance throughout the country . We 'll reward the top five panchayats in two states , Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh , with a cash prize of Rs.5 lakhs ( approximately $10,000 USD ) which they can use to do more good in their communities . <p> The prize will be awarded in one of six areas : education , health and nutrition , water supply , rural infrastructure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include a wide variety of social and income groups , share information with villagers , respond to citizen feedback , and track the quality of programs . <p> We hope the contest helps gram panchayats celebrate successes , share ideas with one another , and improve the quality of public services in villages . Help us show these innovations to the world . The contest is open for applications through January 25 , 2009 . To enter , visit the contest website www.google.org/ggpp.html or pick-up an application at your district or blockpanchayat office in Karnataka or Andhra Pradesh . <p> And , check out what Mr. Mani Shankar Aiyar , the Union Minister of Panchayat Raj had to say about the competition : <h> 12/10/2008 03:29:00 PM <p> As in many parts of the developing world , failure is the norm for urban sanitation services in Ghana . Of the approximately 60 wastewater and faecal sludge treatment plants that exist in the country , less than half have any functional capacity , and fewer than five are operating as designed . The absence of adequate sewage collection and treatment imparts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ghanas urban areas where the risk of epidemics is highest given the large number of people in a confined area . <p> One of the pathways with highest risk of disease transmission is the widespread consumption of raw vegetables irrigated with surface water which is heavily polluted with excreta related pathogens . Over 200,000 people eat such dishes every day in the Accra fast food sector . While most local consumers might have a higher resistance to the diarrhea causing-rotavirus than Ghanas average tourists , there is no resistance when it comes to cholera , as the current outbreak in Zimbabwe shows . <p> Most sanitation models are imported from the developed world and seldom fit the conditions and capacities in low-income countries which explains the catastrophic statistics given above - and jeopardizes their purpose of safeguarding public health . Until this situation changes , it may make sense to challenge the traditional approach and outsource some sanitation-related public services from the financially constrained public sector to those who benefit from the waste stream , like farmers and vegetable sellers . The IWMI works with the World Health Organization and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health risks on farms and in the street food sector where most dishes with raw vegetables are sold . Some of these findings are summarized in videos we 've posted on YouTube . <p> With the support of Google.org and Canada 's International Development Research Council , an international expert group brainstormed under the leadership of IWMI the about research needs to address the health risks in such situations where public sanitation services are constrained . The meeting concluded with the Accra Consensus and a renewed commitment to " rethink " sanitation . We hope you will share your thoughts on this challenge with us after viewing the videos and reading the Accra Consensus document . <h> 12/03/2008 10:09:00 AM <p> Our Predict and Prevent initiative is delighted to announce support to a new regional disease surveillance network called the Southern African Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance ( SACIDS ) . SACIDS is the first regional network to embrace the concept of ' One Health ' right from the start by linking 25 human and animal health institutions in Tanzania , Zambia , Democratic Republic of Congo , Mozambique and South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries from the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) . <p> The SACIDS concept sprang from a Foresight study called ' Infectious Diseases : Preparing for the Future involving more than 400 scientists . SACIDS was developed through meetings with key stakeholders over a period of three years . Its mission is to harness innovation in science and technology in order to improve Southern Africa 's capacity to detect , identify and monitor infectious diseases of humans , animals and plants . By sharing data , experience , training , and tools , the countries participating in SACIDS can raise the quality of disease surveillance for the entire region . <p> With rising international travel and trade , outbreaks can go global within hours . Once diseases are detected , responding quickly and across borders saves lives . " Too often , countries work in isolation , ignoring their neighbors , while diseases cross borders daily . We are thrilled that this effort will increase local cooperation and capacity , " said Professor Mark Rweyemamu , the Executive Director of SACIDS . SACIDS will be physically headquartered at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Google.org will support the establishment of the SACIDS network through an initial $500,000 grant to the Nuclear Threat Initiative 's Global Health and Security Initiative ( GHSI ) . GHSI 's Director for Health Security and Epidemiology Dr. Louise Gresham said , " We look forward to applying our expertise in developing regional surveillance networks , a keystone in building capacity to combat emerging , neglected and endemic disease in Southern Africa . " GHSI will share extensive experience working with regional networks in the Middle East ( the Middle East Consortium on Infectious Disease Surveillance ) and Southeast Asia ( the Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance network ) . In a second phase of the project , Google.org will make an additional contribution of $1,500,000 to African stakeholders working with SACIDS . <p> To learn more about SACIDS and our other partners in Predict and Prevent , download this updated Google Earth layer which highlights the details of their work .
