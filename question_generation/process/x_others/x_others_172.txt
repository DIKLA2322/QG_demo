Last week we introduced Google Correlate , an experimental tool enabling researchers to model real-world behavior using search trends . Weve heard from many researchers who want to mine this data for new discoveries about economics and public healthmuch like we designed Google Flu Trends to give an early warning about flu outbreaks . We hope they 're able to make useful discoveries with Google Correlate . <p> While building Google Correlate , we used it to create an early warning system for another important disease . Google Dengue Trends in Bolivia , Brazil , India , Indonesia and Singapore provides an additional surveillance tool for a disease that affects about 100 million people each year . Dengue is a virus spread through mosquito bites that creates symptoms including high fever , severe headache and pain , rash and mild bleeding . There is no vaccine or treatment , so public health efforts are largely focused on helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Singapore has an impressively timely surveillance system for dengue , but in many countries it can take weeks or months for dengue case data to be collected , analyzed and made available . During the dengue outbreak at last years Commonwealth Games , we discussed the need for timely dengue information . With help from Professor John Brownstein and Emily Chan from HealthMap , a program at Childrens Hospital Boston and Harvard Medical School , we were able to create our system . Using the dengue case count data provided by Ministries of Health and the World Health Organization , were able to build a model that offers near real-time estimates of dengue activity based on the popularity of certain search terms . Google Dengue Trends is automatically updated every day , thereby providing an early indicator of dengue activity . <p> We hope the early warning provided by Google Dengue Trends helps health officials and the public prepare for potential dengue outbreaks . For those who live in places where dengue is present , remember to follow the advice of health officials to prevent infection by wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by gathering standing water .
