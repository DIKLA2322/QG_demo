We also have a mobile page with emergency contact numbers and lists of shelters , and enhanced search results on google.co.id to provide information directly when people search . We 've also included this information in our FreeZone service to reach affected users on feature phones . <p> On both the page and map , which are available in English and Bahasa Indonesia , you 'll see an update on flood locations and related data such as traffic conditions in areas affected by the flooding . <p> To share the page or embed these maps on your own site , click " Share " at the top of the page . <h> Wednesday 1/16/2013 08:00:00 AM <p> The Internet is redefining citizenship in the 21st century . Technology is helping people to connect , engage , and contribute to society and each other like never before.Weve seen developers use our Civic Information API to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our live election results maps have been viewed by billions around the world , bringing real-time transparency to elections in Egypt , Mexico , Ghana , and more . Last week , we launched the Kenya Elections Hub for citizens to access the latest news and resources for the countrys presidential election . Beyond elections , technology can improve everyday civic life : the way we connect , engage , access and act on critical government information . Worldwide , organizations are developing new ways to encourage more open and innovative societies . Google.org is supporting two of these leaders--the Sunlight Foundation and mySociety--and their work on tech solutions for civic innovation.We are providing $2.1 million to the Sunlight Foundation to grow their programs for open government data , with a focus on making civic information for U.S. cities transparent , available , and useable . By opening up information at the city level for developers as well as citizens , Sunlight is creating opportunity for new ideas that can have an impact in local markets.We are also supporting mySociety , providing $1.6 million to build a global platform to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more easily and quickly launch new civic apps and services . This initiative can promote collaboration between civic-minded technologists , regardless of geography . For example , a civic app created in Finland might be easily replicated 9,000 miles away by a developer in Chile.Both organizations are working to bring together a larger community--governments , developers , companies , nonprofits , and citizens--with an interest in improving societies . By creating these open platforms today , we can open doors to ambitious new solutions in the future.Posted by Matthew Stepka , VP , Google.org <h> Monday 1/14/2013 06:30:00 AM <p> One of the best parts about working at Google is the chance to use the Internet and digital technology to help us all manage energy better . Weve seen big changes in recent years to the way we watch TV , use phones , read and listen to music , yet how we use electricity has n't  changed much in decades . <p> What if instead of a monthly bill we had access to more real-time and actionable information about our electricity consumption ? What if our appliances , air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiently and save money ? If we did this in every home it would help improve the reliability of the grid and save billions of dollars . <p> Technology like smart meters and programmable thermostats make it possible to do this today . The challenge is that the rules governing electricity distribution were written for last centurys grid . That 's why Google.org is giving a $2.65M grant to the Energy Foundation to support policy reforms that will lead to more intelligent energy use . The effort will focus on three fundamental areas : <p> Smarter electricity rates that encourage consumers to be more efficient , shift their electricity use to times when its cheaper and produce their own on-site energy ; <p> Access to electricity markets for consumers and other businesses so they can be compensated for cutting energy use at key times ; and <p> Open data policies that give customers access to their own energy data , which they can use or share with third parties they select , promoting better energy management tools and services . <p> These policy reforms , coupled with the new technologies now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make smarter energy choices , improve real-time management of the electricity grid , and help facilitate more renewable energy all while lowering overall costs . <p> We hope this grant will help catalyze change and look forward to seeing progress in the years to come .
