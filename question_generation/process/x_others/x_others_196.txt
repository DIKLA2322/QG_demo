" In 2004 , he organized the Copenhagen Consensus to have teams of economists recommend solutions to the worlds greatest problems . Experts were asked to assess what solutions provided the biggest bang for our buck in areas that spanned politics , economics , and the environment . Google.org adviser Lant Pritchett authored one of the ten " challenge papers " on education , and I did one on water and sanitation . The results were controversial not so much because of what was ranked at the top - HIV/AIDS - but because of what was at the bottom - climate change . <p> On Sunday May 25 , the Danish Prime Minister opened Copenhagen Consensus 2008 , the sequel . Lant Pritchett and I are back too . Lant authored one of two official critiques of the new Education challenge paper . Alix Zwane and I critiqued the 08 Water and Sanitation Challenge Paper by Dale Whittington and colleagues . In our contribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Harvard and UC Berkeley produced . This work , based on results from field work in Kenya , was funded by one of the first Google.org grants and shows that novel water treatment products ( one of which is marketed under the name WaterGuard ) for home use can be cost-effective ways to reduce diarrhea , a major cause of child mortality . In contrast to the research that Alix and I refer to , Whittington 's challenge paper is more pessimistic about whether water and sanitation interventions are the best use of scarce resources that are supposed to improve the lives of the poor . They base this claim mostly on the expense of the technologies they consider ( wells , piped water and sewerage ) . <p> In our review , Alix and I argue that a key reason that water services are not working for the poor is the same reason why other public services are failing the poor : a lack of accountability between providers , policymakers , and consumers that has resulted in bad management and governance . The best technologies in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premise of Google.orgs Inform and Empower Initiative . We believe that accountability is linked to information quality and information flows . Citizens and civil society can hold governments accountable if informed accurately of what is being done . Governments can do a better job of improving coverage levels if they know better where need is greatest . The Inform and Empower initiative supports activities that make this information available and actionable . <p> Tomorrow the panel of 8 economic experts , including 5 Nobel prize winners , will determine its ranking of the Copenhagen Consensus 08 solutions . In the meantime , you can determine your own ranking at Times Online .
