When we looked at our internal data a few months ago we were particularly saddened , although not entirely surprised , to find that the countrys Internet bandwidth -- a critical component of any modern economy -- was radically lower than that of its close neighbors . <p> At the request of the Clinton Foundation , and with some input from external experts like Inveneo , we recently came up with some ideas for improving access to the Internet in Haiti and wrote them up in this paper ( . pdf ) . They include opening TV or other appropriate spectrum for use , as the FCC recently approved in the United States , and different possibilities for connecting to undersea cables that would help make easy , cheap broadband connectivity a reality for Haitians . <p> These are some ideas to start the discussion . Multilateral institutions , entrepreneurs from around the globe , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role in helping the Internet grow there . We believe a stronger Internet means a stronger economy and democracy , and we hope this discussion will help Haiti succeed .

The H1N1 virus posed a new threat to public health and sent governments around the world scrambling to protect peoples well-being . We do n't  yet know the severity of this flu season , but have learned in the past that many people come to Google to search for information about the flu . <p> In time for the upcoming flu season , Google is again collaborating with the U.S. Department for Health and Human Services ( HHS ) , their flu.gov collaborators and the American Lung Association to release a feature which allows people to more easily find nearby locations for getting the flu vaccine . By searching for terms like flu or flu shot , information will appear at the top of your search results , including tips from flu.gov as well as the flu vaccine finder box with an expanding map that displays locations where you can receive vaccine . <p> This years flu vaccine protects against the three viruses that research suggests will be most common , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for multiple vaccines . <p> We continue to hope for a relatively uneventful flu season , but encourage you to prepare appropriately . <p> Update on 9/30 : Kathleen Sebelius , Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services , just announced that the flu vaccine finder is now embedded on flu.gov , along with instructions for how others can embed it on their site .

I thought I might run a foundation . After our meeting , I realized that this was an entrepreneurial company that could really change with world with technology.Nearly ten years later , I am retiring from Google to advise startups and social innovators . I will also informally counsel on Google.org efforts . While sad to leave , it has been a terrific ride . Building our Business Operations and People Operations groups , I had the opportunity to develop business strategy , organizational process , and the most important ingredientthe peopleto help fuel a rapidly growing Google . In my decade as a Googler , the Internet has transformed the way we respond to critical human challenges . From ourearly days , Google has pledged to use technology to tackle big problems , and we continue to deliver on that promise todaywhether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the U.S. , Mexico , and Egypt , or investing nearly $1 billion in renewable energy projects that can become major power sources for the future.It has been incredibly rewarding to end my time at Google leading social impact efforts such as Google.org , Google Green , Crisis Response , Google Giving , and Elections . These teams are improving the world with great leaders at the helm . VP Matthew Stepka will step into my role of day-to-day leadership , while CFO Patrick Pichette will take on a more engaged role from our executive team . A lot has changed in ten years . But one thing has stayed the same . Google and others are finding new ways to tackle our biggest problems with technology . I 'm proud to be a part of that work .
