People can share their knowledge and research directly through the site and help keep the content up-to-date . A diverse group of collaborators have already begun to contribute content ranging from 18th-century manuscripts to modern teaching tools like video and audio language samples and knowledge-sharing articles . Members of the Advisory Committee have also provided guidance , helping shape the site and ensure that it addresses the interests and needs of language communities . <p> Google has played a role in the development and launch of this project , but the long-term goal is for true experts in the field of language preservation to take the lead .

Back in 2008 , a team at Google dug into this behavior and found that certain search terms were good indicators of flu levels . We later launched Google Flu Trends to estimate flu activity in near real-time using aggregated Google search data , in regions around the world . <p> At the end of every flu season , we evaluate the performance of our model . Are our estimates accurate ? What worked well , or not so well ? Do we need to make any updates ? After the 2009 H1N1 season , for example , we updated the model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2009 , the model had performed well at the national and regional levels in the US and no update was needed . <p> Flu Trends can help estimate the start , peak , and duration of each flu season--all important information for public health agencies . During the 2012-2013 season in the US , the model performed well in estimating the start and duration of the season . However , the model overestimated the severity of the flu . In January 2013 , after spotting the difference between our estimates and the percentage of healthcare visits for influenza-like illnesses ( ILI ) reported by the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) , we started to investigate the high estimates . We found that heightened media coverage on the severity of the flu season resulted in an extended period in which users were searching for terms we 've identified as correlated with flu levels . In early 2013 , we saw more flu-related searches in the US than ever before . <p> We evaluated several options to improve the model . Ultimately , we determined that an update using the peak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity for recent seasons . We will be applying this update to the US flu level estimates for the 2013-2014 flu season , starting from August 1st . A casual observer will see that the new model forecasts a lower flu level than last years model did at a similar time in the season . We believe the new model more closely approximates CDC data . <p> You can check out the new models estimates against previous years flu levels in this graph : <p> For those of you who want more data and details , we presented this paper recently at the ISNTD Bites conference . This is an iterative process . We will keep exploring how we can build resilience to accommodate the effect of news media . In the meantime , stay healthy ! <h> Wednesday 10/23/2013 12:02:00 PM <p> A catastrophe or natural disaster can occur when least expected . That 's why the Google Crisis Response Team created Public Alerts and Crisis Map to help people better prepare for these unfortunate situations . Today , were launching Google Public Alerts and Crisis Map in Colombia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during , and after a natural disaster such as a tropical storm , hurricane , flood or landslide.Starting today , relevant information about extreme weather changes which threaten the safety of Colombians will appear on Google Public Alerts as well as emergency related information for impacted areas on Crisis Map . This information will also be displayed in Google Search , Google Maps , Google Maps Mobile and Google Now . Our goal at Google Crisis Response is to provide citizens with the critical information needed in an emergency . Were able to provide Public Alerts and Crisis Map in Colombia thanks to the support of the Colombian Institute of Hydrology , Meteorology and Environmental Studies ( IDEAM ) and the National Unit for Disaster Risk Management ( UNGRD ) . Colombia is the first country in Latin America to implement the system . Public Alerts is currently available in five other countries : Australia , Canada , Japan , Taiwan , and the United States . <p> Google Public Alerts and Crisis Map <p> Google Public Alerts helps you find important weather information without even looking for it by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floods , and providing instructions for severe weather conditions and non-weather alerts such as missing persons , wildfires and earthquakes . This information is displayed on Google Maps , Google Search and Google Now when you activate it on your Android device . <p> Example of the Google Public Alerts global page <p> Google Public Alerts now provides accurate and relevant emergency alerts when and where you need them in Colombia . For example , if a red alert is issued for flooding in your area , you 'll see the alert when doing a relevant search on Google or Google Maps , either on desktop or mobile , and will have access to timely information : <p> Example of a Google Search result showing a red alert <p> You can see alert details through the More information link .

That 's why we 've launched aGoogle Crisis Mapto show fire information across five Australian states and territories.The Google Crisis Mapshows information about current fires including their location and size the level of alert , whether the fire is under control and which local emergency response agency is responding to the crisis .

Celerate will extend this technology to rural wireless networks , with an eye toward research as well as providing real network services to users.De Novo Group is working with researchers from Stanford University and UC Berkeley , and is now working to find a community for the first deployments ( ideally , located in Northern California , close to the project team ) .

Could you pay ? What might you have to give up ? For billions of people , these costs--and questions--are an unaffordable reality that stop them from accessing the Web . <p> Today , Google is joining more than 30 members to launch the Alliance for Affordable Internet ( A4AI ) , a new coalition that cuts across boundaries of geography , sector , or size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through policy change . <p> New technologies play a crucial role in bringing the Internet to more people worldwide--weve developed and invested in many of these big ideas over the years .

Policy change can help new innovation take hold and flourish ; outdated policies can stifle progress . In Kenya and other markets that have adopted national broadband plans , policy change has delivered results , fast . A4AI will focus on those policy changes that can bolster new access technologies and initiatives and make the Internet more affordable to people worldwide . <p> Initiated by the World Wide Web Foundation , A4AI includes members from the technology , government , and nonprofit worlds , from developed and developing countries . Google--along with other Global Sponsors--joined the alliance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , as well as rally more members that share our mission for affordable Internet access . <p> A4AI has a specific goal in mind : to reach the UN Broadband Commission target of entry-level broadband access priced at less than 5% of monthly income worldwide . ( According to the ITU , households in the developing world pay roughly 30% of monthly income for a fixed connection , so there 's a lot of work to do . ) Were working with A4AI on several initial projects , including : <p> Working directly with governments , with plans to engage with 10+ countries by the end of 2015 <p> Releasing the first edition of an annual affordability report <p> Ultimately , A4AI is about making the world a more connected place . Over 90% of people in the 49 least developed countries are still not online .

The recovery period is likely to be lengthy as major roads are repaired and communities clean up.In response to the disaster , Google Crisis Response worked closely with the local team to launch a Crisis Map showing aerial photos , shelters , road closures and more . Public Alerts notified people of flash flood warnings . The team worked closely with the Colorado Office of Emergency Management , as well as the Boulder Office of Emergency Management and other county response agencies to get updates to those affected . Google has also donated $50,000 to the Red Cross to support relief and rebuilding efforts .
