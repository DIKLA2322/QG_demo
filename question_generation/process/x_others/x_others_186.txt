Meanwhile , people living in parts of the world without wired infrastructure rely on wireless broadband for their last mile connection . As more people go online and the number of wireless devices grows , so does the need for spectrum . <p> There is available spectrum out there -- but it can be hard to find if you do n't know where to look . One way we 're trying to help researchers and other stakeholders identify available spectrum is through dynamic spectrum sharing . Spectrum sharing allows devices to use spectrum when it is not in use by someone else simply by checking a data base . We 're in the process ( with several others ) of becoming a certified database administrator for a band of spectrum called the TV white spaces . <p> Today , we 've reached a milestone in the certification process : our database is beginning a public trial with the FCC . Our trial site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ users , licensed spectrum holders ) to test and provide feedback on the database . The trial site also allows anyone to find out how much TV white spaces spectrum is available at any location , such as your home or office . <p> Google Earth visualization of available TV whitespace spectrum . <p> The completion of the trial will bring us all one step closer to freeing up more spectrum , which in turn will help the industry bring new wireless technologies to market and enable people to get wireless Internet access when and where they need it .
