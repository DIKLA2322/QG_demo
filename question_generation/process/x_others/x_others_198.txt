@@13269119 @1869119/ <h> Tuesday 11/12/2013 10:17:00 AM <p> We 've launched several tools , available on our Typhoon Yolanda crisis page , to help gather and relay information in connection with the incredible devastation that 's occurred in the Philippines . <p> These resources include Google Person Finder , a web application that allows individuals to post and search for the status of family or friends affected by the disaster . If you 're worried about someone , then click on " I 'm Looking for Someone " and type in their name . If you want to let people know you 're safe or have heard from someone in the area , then click on " I have information about someone " and put in their names and details . As the number of names and records build , the tool will hopefully make it easier for those who are safe to pass on their news to anyone worried about them . <p> We 've also made Person Finder available on mobile phones . You can request status via SMS by sending an SMS to 2662999 ( Globe subscribers ) , 4664999 ( SMART subscribers ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the message " Search " and then the persons name . For example , if you are searching for Joshua Reyes , send the message " Search Joshua Reyes " . <p> These tools are open to anyone to embed on their Web sites - here are instructions for embedding person finder , and you can click the " Share " button at the top of the crisis map to embed or share by email or social media . <p> The more people who contribute to them , the more useful theyll be . <p> Update November 12 : we 're also providing $500,000 , split between two organizations working on the ground , CARE and the Philippine Red Cross , to aid with relief efforts . If you would like to make a donation , we 've provided links to these and other organizations on our crisis landing page .
