Considering many ideas , we talked about what it will take to finally eradicate polio in the developing world , and the role that philanthropy can play . Many of our parents remember what it was like to have polio in this country , and a few people in the States still reside in iron lungs . These generations are advancing , and it 's important that we not forget how horrible the crippling of polio can be to those who are at risk today . <p> The community of nations , health workers and funders have come very close to wiping polio off the map : in 1988 over 350,000 cases of polio were reported ; last year that number had declined to approximately 2,000 reported cases , afflicting mostly children under age 3 in just a few countries India , Nigeria , Afghanistan and Pakistan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eradication for decades , such as the Rotarians who have raised and given more than $600 million for polio eradication . Although the finish line is in sight , the global effort needs all of our support to reach the end goal . <p> Along with other efforts here , google.org is funding a documentary film with Vermilion Films Founder , and Emmy and 2007 Sundance award winner Irene Taylor Brodsky , to tell the story of the public health heroes on the front lines of polio vaccination and eradication . We 're hopeful this film will re-energize the group of dedicated donors and health workers to bring this campaign over the finish line . Throughout the project , Irene will share a few stories from the field . <p> And yes , welcome to the google.org blog . We are fortunate to be able to occasionally post to the Official Google Blog , and today we 're starting a blog of our own . We 'll invite posts by our team members and other Googlers about what they 're working on , and by our grantees and partners on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . We hope to include some of their reports and updates , as well as thoughts shared by guest bloggers.
