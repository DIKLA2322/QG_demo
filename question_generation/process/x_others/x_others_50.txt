" While the delegates continued negotiations on an international climate change agreement , several events highlighted efforts by local communities around the world to confront the climate crisis and secure their own clean energy future . <p> Local cities from Milano , Italy to Betim , Brazil to Bhubaneswar , India shared their experiences deploying renewable energy projects in their cities . In partnership with ICLEI , they have banded together with other cities around the world ( ICLEI map below of participating cities below ) to share expertise and best practices on renewable energy and energy efficiency . <p> The U.S. Climate Acton Network highlighted efforts by U.S. states ( including 9 of the country 's 10 largest emitting states ) to reduce emissions , along with the pledge by over 700 U.S. mayors to meet the Kyoto Protocol targets in their cities and towns . Other innovative programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan ; Chapel Hill , North Carolina 's free public transit ; and the City of Austin 's plan to power all city facilities with 100% renewable power . <p> The flurry of local activity represents some frustration with the pace of international action , according to German Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul . " We ca n't wait for every detail to be correct at the international level ; we have to act now and we can act now if we act locally . " Monika Zimmermann of ICLEI hopes the ' can-do ' attitude of state and local governments will be contagious . " We 're not just doing the right thing for our own sake , we want to prompt national governments and the international community to follow our lead . "
