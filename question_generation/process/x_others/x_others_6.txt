The panelists focused on the important role innovation plays in seizing the economic benefits of developing and deploying cost-effective low carbon technologies . <p> These policies , if adopted and supported , will help us at last put in place what has been lacking in terms of clean energy innovation : a robust pipeline extending from basic research to applied research to demonstration projects to commercial scale-up to full deployment . At Google , we call this cycle " Lightbulbs to Lightbulbs " -- from the initial " lightbulb moment " of invention to full commercial deployment . Each one of these steps is vital to the whole process . Ignoring any of these steps can inhibit the effectiveness of the whole innovation cycle . <p> Watch the full event here : <p> With equal measures of smart policy , investment and will , we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solving climate change and boosting the American economy .

On our energy-monitoring software tool , Google PowerMeter , this shows up as a dark green bar on your power usage graph .

If these users reduced that amount by just 100 watts each , that 's a significant cumulative savings .
