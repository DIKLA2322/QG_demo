Our hearts go out to those who have been affected by this devastation and were deeply grateful to those who are working to keep us safe . In the meantime , Googlers in Japan and elsewhere around the world have been working around the clock to try and help improve the flow of information . Here are some of the recent developments we 've been working on : <p> Centralized informationOur Crisis Response pagenow in Japanese , English , Chinese and Koreanorganizes all of Googles efforts , with links to valuable resources such as emergency hotlines , Person Finder , blackout schedules , maps and links to relief organizations receiving donations . Ninety-three percent of mobile users in Japan do n't  have top-of-the-line smartphones , so weve recently optimized this Crisis Response page to make it more readable for a wider range of devices . You can also access that version by scanning this QR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earthquake , we launched Person Finder so people can enter the names of those they 're looking for or have found . You can now also search by entering mobile phone numbers to see if they match any listings . And as with the Crisis Response page , Person Finder has also been optimized for those without smartphones . There are currently more than 250,000 records in the database ( including names shared with us by NHK , the national broadcaster in Japan ) and we 've heard several reports of people who have found their loved ones safe . <p> To help the many people in shelters get word of their whereabouts to loved ones , were also asking people in shelters to take photos of the handwritten lists of names of current residents and email them to us . Those photos are automatically uploaded to a public Picasa Web Album . We use scanning technology to help us manually add these names to Person Finder ; but its a big job that ca n't be done automatically by computers alone , so we welcome volunteers with Japanese language skills who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our satellite partners GeoEye and DigitalGlobe to provide frequent updates to our imagery of the hardest-hit areas to first responders as well as the general public .

Weve mapped rolling blackouts for areas that are affected by power outages . With data given to us by Honda , you can now see which roads have been recently passable on this map or this user-made Google Earth mashup with new satellite imagery . Were also constantly updating a master map ( in Japanese and English ) with other data such as epicenter locations and evacuation shelters . And with information from the newspaper Mainichi , we 've published a partial list of shelters . <p> TranslationUse Google Translate for Japanese and 56 other languages .

As consumers embrace electric vehicles , weve also been adding information to Google Maps over the past few months to help users find charging stations . Just search on Google Maps for " ev charging station " plus the appropriate area , for example , " ev charging station near mountain view ca . " <p> We 'd like to continue adding more charging stations to Google Maps , so were excited that our friends over at the the U.S. Department of Energys National Renewable Energy Laboratory ( NREL ) are working to make more data available . <p> NREL has launched the GeoEVSE Forum to help develop a detailed , accurate database of electric vehicle charging stations . Well be adding more EV charging locations to Google Maps as their database , and others , are updated . As always , you can use the Report a problem tool to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an automaker , an electric vehicle charging station manufacturer or installer , an EV consumer group or any other interested party , you can join the GeoEVSE Forum by visiting this site . <p> We look forward to adding even more information to Google Maps to help you recharge your electric vehicle . Happy green driving !

Once approved , those additions are then reflected on Google Maps and Google Earth for others around the world to see . <p> The Google Map Maker data includes detailed maps of more than 150 countries and regions , and identifies locations like schools , hospitals , roads , settlements and water points that are critical for relief workers to know about in times of crisis . The data will also be useful for planning purposes , as governments and their development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructure and development projects ; make them more transparent for NGOs , researchers , and individual citizens ; and more effectively identify areas that might be in need of assistance before a disaster strikes . <p> Community mapper in Kampala , Uganda <p> World Bank partner organizations , which include government and United Nations agencies , will be able to contact World Bank offices for possible access to the Google Map Maker data for their various projects . World Bank country offices in Kenya , South Sudan , Tanzania , Sierra Leone , Ghana , Zambia , Nigeria , Democratic Republic of Congo , Moldova , Mozambique , Nepal , and Haiti plan to pilot the Map Maker agreement . <p> Google has enjoyed a strong relationship with World Bank for many years . As indicated by the World Bank Vice President for the Africa Region Obiageli Ezekwesili , " Todays technology can empower civil society , including the diaspora , to collaborate and support the development process . This collaboration is about shifting the emphasis from organizations to people , and empowering them to solve their own problems and develop their own solutions using maps . "
