@@13268816 @1868816/ <h> Datasets <p> Earth Engine 's public data catalog includes a variety of standard Earth science raster datasets . You can import these datasets into your script environment with a single click . You can also upload your own raster data or vector data for private use or sharing in your scripts . <h> Landsat <p> Landsat , a joint program of the USGS and NASA , has been observing the Earth continuously from 1972 through the present day . Today the Landsat satellites image the entire Earth 's surface at a 30-meter resolution about once every two weeks , including multispectral and thermal data . Earth Engine makes this data available in its raw form , as TOA-corrected reflectance , and in various ready-to-use computed products such as NDVI and EVI vegetation indices . <h> MODIS <p> The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) sensors on NASA 's Terra and Aqua satellites have been acquiring images of the Earth daily since 1999 . The Earth Engine catalog includes a variety of data products that NASA produces from MODIS data , including daily imagery , 16-day BRDF-adjusted surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow cover . <h> High-Resolution Imagery <p> High-resolution imagery captures the finer details of landscapes and urban environments . The US National Agriculture Imagery Program ( NAIP ) offers aerial image data of the US at one-meter resolution , including nearly complete coverage every several years since 2003 . Earth Engine includes this data as well as sample imagery from several commercial providers . <h> Other Imagery Data <p> Data from other satellite image sensors is available in Earth Engine as well , including night-time imagery from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program 's Operational Linescan System ( DMSP-OLS ) , which has collected imagery of night-time lights at approximately 1-kilometer resolution continuously since 1992 . <h> Land Cover <p> Land cover maps describe the physical landscape in terms of land cover classes such as forest , grassland , and water . Earth Engine includes a wide variety land cover datasets , including global products such as NASA 's MODIS-derived annual land cover maps and ESA 's GlobCover , as well as higher-resolution national products such as the USGS National Land Cover Database . <h> Cropland <p> Cropland data is key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Engine includes a number of cropland data products such as the USDA NASS Cropland Data Layers , as well as layers from the Global Food Security-Support Analysis Data ( GFSAD ) including cropland extent , crop dominance , and watering sources . <h> Surface Temperature <p> Thermal satellite sensors can provide surface temperature and emissivity information . The Earth Engine data catalog includes both land and sea surface temperature products derived from several spacecraft sensors , including MODIS , ASTER , and AVHRR , in addition to raw Landsat thermal data . <h> Atmospheric Data <p> You can use atmospheric data to help correct image data from other sensors , or you can study it in its own right . The Earth Engine catalog includes atmospheric datasets such as ozone data from NASA 's TOMS and OMI instruments and the MODIS Monthly Gridded Atmospheric Product . <h> Weather <p> Weather datasets describe forecasted and measured conditions over short periods of time , including precipitation , temperature , humidity , and wind , and other variables . Earth Engine includes forecast data from NOAA 's Global Forecast System ( GFS ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as sensor data from sources like the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission ( TRMM ) . <h> WorldPop <p> Population density is key to understanding the relationship between humanity and the environment . The Earth Engine data catalog includes WorldPop estimated population density data covering much of the world , including South America , Africa , and Southeast Asia , at various points in time . <h> Malaria Data <p> Earth Engine also includes data produced by the Oxford Malaria Atlas Project that captures the incidence and prevalence of Pf malaria in Africa , the deployment of various interventions over time , and a set of global covariates that can be used for parasite modeling and risk mapping .
