But weve only scratched the surface on the potential of the Web . Today , 5 billion people still do n't  have access to the Internet and the opportunity it provides.Google is doing work to get more people connected , especially in places where Internet access lags the most . In Sub-Saharan Africa , we 've created programs such as Google Apps Supporting Programs for Education , offered technical assistance such as caches for Internet providers , and generated ideas to build Internet capacity . To help bring the next billion people online , Google.org is announcing today our support of two organizations that share our mission to connect the world : the Network Startup Resource Center ( NSRC ) and the Internet Society ( ISOC ) . We are providing $3.1M to the NSRC to grow their work to bring local network engineering expertise to universities and national research &amp; education networks ( NRENs ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , NSRC will provide hands-on training on campus network planning , deployment , and management for over 600 university and NREN staff . Their work will bring the Internet to students and staff at over 50 institutions and increase network engineering know-how in Sub-Saharan Africa . <p> KENET-NSRC Campus Network Design Workshop , Photo : NSRC <p> Lesotho IXP setup .

IXPs play a big role in core Internet infrastructure , allowing Internet Service Providers to peer locally ( and cheaply ) , which can lower end user costs , promote competition , and improve user experience . ISOC will create a toolkit for those who want to create and improve IXPs and build an industry portal to share IXP information and data.Some of the brightest minds are working to improve lives in new ways through the Internet . By supporting the work of NSRC and ISOC , we can make sure that those opportunities are available to more people in more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Principal , Google.org

Last week we introduced Google Correlate , an experimental tool enabling researchers to model real-world behavior using search trends . Weve heard from many researchers who want to mine this data for new discoveries about economics and public healthmuch like we designed Google Flu Trends to give an early warning about flu outbreaks . We hope they 're able to make useful discoveries with Google Correlate . <p> While building Google Correlate , we used it to create an early warning system for another important disease . Google Dengue Trends in Bolivia , Brazil , India , Indonesia and Singapore provides an additional surveillance tool for a disease that affects about 100 million people each year . Dengue is a virus spread through mosquito bites that creates symptoms including high fever , severe headache and pain , rash and mild bleeding .

With help from Professor John Brownstein and Emily Chan from HealthMap , a program at Childrens Hospital Boston and Harvard Medical School , we were able to create our system . Using the dengue case count data provided by Ministries of Health and the World Health Organization , were able to build a model that offers near real-time estimates of dengue activity based on the popularity of certain search terms . Google Dengue Trends is automatically updated every day , thereby providing an early indicator of dengue activity . <p> We hope the early warning provided by Google Dengue Trends helps health officials and the public prepare for potential dengue outbreaks .

Disease spreads rapidly with over one billion people forced to defecate outside due to a lack of sanitation and indoor plumbing ; in fact , unsafe water and sanitation is the most important environmental cause of ill-health , with millions dying every year as a result of poor water , sanitation and hygiene conditions . Young children in particular tend to suffer from water-borne diseases such as diarrhoea . <p> Success in water supply and sanitation interventions is commonly measured in terms of the number of wells dug , public water points connected or public toilets constructed . This is what the official data - available at national scale only - reflect . The assumption is that every water point and every toilet will provide adequate and sustainable services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , wells run dry , hand pumps break , toilets go " out-of-service , " or the quality of the water provided is not safe . <p> As a result the official data seriously underestimate the water and sanitation crisis . A realistic assessment requires continuous monitoring at local levels . Modern technology now makes that possible . <p> The H2.0group of partners set out to demonstrate that community level monitoring of operational water and sanitation services is feasible at national scales . Google.org is one of the H2.0 partners . We have co-funded the effort and provided technical support . Yesterday the group launched the H2.0 platform at a World Water Week event in Stockholm . Over the past several years , the partners have collected detailed water and sanitation service data and developed a data management and mapping platform . This platform will enable users open access to analyse , visualise and interact with the data . We want to support government and development partners prioritize water investments and help NGOs and service providers assess their performance in a transparent manner . <p> Three components of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that the number of people with access to safe and affordable water is significantly lower than official estimates have previously shown : <p> For Kenya , the initial analysis of data collected by the Water Services Trust Fund shows , according to Han Seur of GTZ , that : " In over a thousand low income urban areas with a total population over 4.5 million less than 25% have access to safe and affordable water . " <p> For TanzaniaWaterAid and partners mapped over 25 thousand rural public water points in 2006 . Vincent Casey of WaterAid summarized their report as : " Water point data mapped by WaterAid Tanzania has demonstrated that nearly half ( 46% ) of rural water points are not functional . A quarter of all new water points are no longer working just two years after installation . " <p> For Zanzibar , according to Graham Alabaster of UN-Habitat : " Counting only those who are paying less 10% of their income for water as having affordable access , the water access rate had to be revised from 90% down to 22% . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis is affecting two to three times more people in the areas surveyed than the official data suggest . <p> Better data on water services can help consumers hold their water service provider accountable . H2.0 partner ITC developed the Human Sensor Web , a system that allows Zanzibar citizens to report water outages by SMS and receive alert messages on water quality and availability . <p> To understand the issue and invest in solutions that work , we need to stop measuring success as construction of taps and toilets , and start measuring success by monitoring the number of people with sustainable access to safe and affordable water and sanitation services .
