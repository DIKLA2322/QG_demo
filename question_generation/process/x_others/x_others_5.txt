In 2010 , founder Sal Khan was recording educational tutorials in a walk-in closet , uploading them to YouTube , and sharing them with the world for free . Seven years later , Khan Academy has grown into a robust library of thousands of videos , articles , and interactive exercises covering preschool learning , math , biology , chemistry , physics , economics , finance , history , grammar , and more . Khan Academy is also being translated into dozens of languages . Ten million people use the platform worldwide every year . <p> A growing factbase indicates that time spent on Khan Academy correlates with improved learning . In a year-long longitudinal study of 5,000 students in Idaho , students who completed more than 60% of their assigned mission ( a series of curriculum aligned lessons ) in mathematics enjoyed 1.8x the expected academic growth compared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As Khan Academy has grown , so too has Google.org 's support , which to date includes $11 million in funding , volunteer hours , and other resources to help Khan Academy build critical tools for students , enhance its data infrastructure , create new content , and more deeply engage with and serve teachers everywhere . Google.org has also helped Khan Academy invest in the development of its intelligent software , deep data analytics and intuitive user interfaces that make these resources useful to students and teachers around the world . <p> Khan Academy is employing its most recent grant from Google.org to build for a future where even more learners come from countries and communities where language , connectivity , and other barriers limit access to digital educational content . Strategic investments in its core product infrastructure will help the Khan Academy team build highly localized learning experiences based on varying curriculum standards , language needs , and levels of connectivity .

The insights from these surveys show that while more than 96% of children are enrolled in school in rural India , about half of all fifth graders still can not read a simple text or do basic arithmetic . By assessing learning levels , ASER helps to make sure that students are not only in school , but that attention is also paid to children 's learning . <p> In 2016 , Google.org donated $3 million toward devices and an additional $3.1 million to support Pratham 's Hybrid Learning Program " an initiative that empowers students to use self driven , tablet-based curricula to learn outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grade organize themselves into groups of five . Two groups share a tablet and children in each group decide together what content they 'd like to learn . Along with learning science , English and math , students also learn how to work collaboratively with their peers and foster their curiosity . <p> The data collected from the program will help Pratham and the broader sector better understand how a student focused model can accompany more traditional teacher focused models , with the hope of scaling these methodologies across India 's rural school ecosystem . The data will also help Pratham develop content that is engaging , relevant , and enriching . Googler volunteers will be contributing to these data analysis efforts .
