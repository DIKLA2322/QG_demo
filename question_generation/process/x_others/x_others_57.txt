Dr. Stephen Schneider , a Stanford Professor and a global leader in climate change science died Monday morning of a heart attack . <p> Steve was an important mentor and friend to me , as I know he was to many scientists and activists around the world . For many years I turned to Steve for advice on climate science and insights into the political process . I remember one line he often repeated to me : <p> " Amy , when it comes to climate science , always stick to the facts , the truth is bad enough . " <p> Steve was brilliant at communicating the facts in plain language always driving home the message of risk .

His response in a late night email was : <p> " Nope , I wont be there . I was at first two , as described in detail in Science as a Contact Sportwe got the ball rolling .
