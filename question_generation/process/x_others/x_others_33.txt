We want to encourage others in the energy monitoring space to do the same . To this end , I 'd like to introduce our most recent strategic partner Microchip , which is a supplier of cost-effective , innovative products for the embedded developer . Today , Microchip will include as part of their developer demonstration environment the Google PowerMeter API library that we recently announced . This integration will make it much easier to create devices compatible with Google PowerMeter which means one can more quickly go from concept to demo to product . <p> The Google PowerMeter API is designed to work with a variety of energy monitoring devices - from utilities with smart meters , back haul networks and enterprise scale meter data management systems - to small embedded consumer devices that can send energy information directly to Google PowerMeter . <p> Google 's belief in open source also means that the Google PowerMeter API library is available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tinkerers and makers are welcome to explore the code and use it in their products . <p> As we search for clean energy alternatives , it is important that everyone - from utilities to garage inventors - get a chance to try out new technologies and methods so that we all benefit from their inspirations.
