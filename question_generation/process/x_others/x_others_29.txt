@@13268978 @1868978/ <h> Tuesday 12/23/2008 10:39:00 AM <p> As you might expect from a company founded by two engineers and an infusion of start up cash , Google believes in the power of entrepreneurs and small businesses to drive innovation and spur job growth . So it was n't surprising that when we considered areas to support with our philanthropic efforts , helping entrepreneurs in developing countries rose to the top . This past January we launched an initiative to Fuel the Growth of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises ( SMEs ) . SMEs in developed countries account for half of GDP and two-thirds of jobs , but they 're largely absent in developing countries . We wanted to explore how we could help drive capital to these high-growth businesses . At the same time , we launched a parallel effort to increase access to vital information in poor countries . This effort , known as Inform and Empower , aims to help improve the quality of public services by organizing critical information and making it accessible to all ( sound familiar ? ) . <p> We still strongly believe that growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Google 's ten organizing principles is , " it 's best to do one thing really , really well . " As we evaluated our efforts this past year , it became clear that given Google.org 's unique strengths - including the ability to tap Google engineers to build and link better pathways to information - we could have a greater impact on the lives of the poor by focusing our efforts on Inform and Empower . As a result , we 're putting our SME initiative on the back burner . We 'll continue to support the grants and investments that we 've already committed under the initiative . We have observed and learned from many others addressing the challenges of financing SMEs -- many of whom are seeing significant strong results -- and we hope they continue with great success . At this time , however , we will not fund new efforts in the SME space . <p> Google remains committed to its philanthropic goal : using information and technology to take on some of the world 's greatest challenges . We continue to draw upon resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as outlined by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in their 2004 letter to investors . We 've had a strong year of giving since the launch of our initiatives . We know that the global financial crisis is disproportionately affecting the poor and plan to increase our overall giving in 2009 . <h> Friday 12/19/2008 11:53:00 AM <p> In early 2008 , Google.org announced its initiatives to the world and made clear how the company would leverage its people , money , and creativity to address some of the worlds most pressing and difficult problems . Among them were climate change/renewable energy , global poverty , and emerging threats . <p> In Africa , one of our initiatives is focused on leveraging the power of information ( or the right to know ) to increase transparency , accountability , and ultimately the delivery and quality of public services . " You ca n't change what you cant see " is one of our mantras , and our job is to shine light in dark places and help people decipher the black box of public service delivery . What is working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to plug holes in a leaky pipeline of service delivery ? <p> Much of the initiative is about unlocking quasi-public information . One of my colleagues calls it DBHD ( database hugging disorder ) . Why is so much " public " information not accessible ( ie government budgets , service level indicators , population data ) and sitting on servers in London , New York , and Geneva but not accessible to citizens , media , and even planners in Africa countries ? This clearly needs to change . <p> What is less intuitive , however , is that there is so much information , knowledge , and wisdom within Africa that is not making its way to politicians , planners , and policy makers who make decisions about Africa . We often hear that teachers , nurses , and civil servants do not show-up for work across the continent and this is a primary contributor to the poor quality of public services . Do we bother asking why absenteeism is such a problem ? Ask teachers , nurses , or administrators and they will tell you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was adopted in many African countries more than a decade ago , classroom sizes have doubled if not tripled while teacher salaries , instructional materials , and training have hardly changed at all . Government dispensaries are rarely stocked with medications that people come to purchase so why bother staffing clinics ? <p> Last month in rural Uganda , I saw an example of how information gathered from students is helping a local NGO address pupil absenteeism in a very targeted way . The primary school has created a student-led club that investigates why students are missing school and why they drop-out . After all , fellow students face similar challenges and know much about their peers . It turns out that most students dropping out are girls ; early pregnancy and lack of finances to purchase school uniforms are leading causes of student absenteeism . <p> With this information in hand , the Kabarole Research Centre is working with student leaders to plant a community garden to raise money to buy uniforms for needy students , and both are working with community leaders and parents committees to raise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Several young girls have returned to school after giving birth , and school administrators are more aware of what needs to happen to reduce student attrition . <p> And so its not just about delivering information to people so they can make better decisions . Its also about listening to people to make sure donors , planners , and government officials make better decisions . Using student leaders to understand better why their peers are missing school may seem obvious , but such approaches are pretty rare in top-down systems . Better information is certainly not a panacea but its a necessary condition to make better decisions based on evidence rather than anecdote . <h> Thursday 12/18/2008 10:40:00 AM <p> There 's a great deal of talk about the high cost of oil and the billions of dollars that the US and other oil-importing nations spend each year to buy oil . As part of the Google.org Geo Challenge Grants Program , Rocky Mountain Institute ( RMI ) has created a map of US oil imports by country since 1973 .

While this map highlights data on United States oil imports , the picture is similar for every oil-importing country in the world . <p> The map highlights 5 eras of oil consumption , from the oil shocks of the 1970s to the price collapse in the 1980s to recent events including Hurricane Katrina and gas approaching $5 per gallon before retreating rapidly recently . ( You can see these selections by clicking on the buttons below the map on the RMI website . ) One interesting time period is from 1982 to 1985 , when low prices caused oil imports from the Middle East to decline to very low levels . <p> The map also looks at potential oil from offshore drilling and exploration of the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge ( ANWR ) . The screenshot below illustrates the impact of off-shore drilling . With the map zoomed or drilled 3-5 levels down and centered near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , check out the very thin line that shows the potential peak production of 220,000 barrels per day.The lines represent estimates of production in 20-30 years , and even with this very long timeline , the amount of oil that could be generated from offshore drilling is miniscule compared to our oil needs today . <p> Both Google and RMI are working hard to help create a future where we are not reliant on daily imports of millions of barrels of oil that pollute our atmosphere and risk our national security . <p> Today , along with the Brookings Institution , RMI is hosting " The Oil Solutions Initiative " a summit to identify solutions to break Americas dependence on oil , with Google in attendance . In 2004 , RMIs Chief Scientist , Chairman and Co-founder Amory Lovins and a team of RMI collaborators drafted Winning the Oil Endgame ( PDF of the book ) - a roadmap for the United States to get completely off oil by 2050 . <p> Google.orgs RechargeIT initiative is driving toward the commercialization of plug-in vehicles that can wean the US off gasoline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing conventional automobile mileage , deploying millions of plug-in hybrids and accelerating the turnover of the fleet would reduce oil consumption by 51% by 2030 . That decrease would have an even larger effect on oil imports because we produce about one-third of our oil in the US . Google and RMI have worked together on a number of projects including RMIs Smart GarageCharrette , a summit to identify the barriers and breakthroughs needed to electrify the U.S. auto fleet . <p> While oil prices have declined rapidly over the past five months , most people expect oil prices to remain high into the near future . When asked whether or not the drop in oil prices reduces the need to act , President-Elect Barack Obama responded that we go from " shock to trance " and as a result " never make any progress .

Today , panchayats are responsible for implementing development programs . They often create positive change at the grassroots level , but their success stories are n't  as well known as they should be . For example in Kerala , a panchayat that was committed to education made sure the entire village was completely literate . And in the Thar district of Rajasthan , a panchayat converted the area into a tourist destination , increasing the incomes of inhabitants . <p> Today we 're launching the Google.org Gram Panchayat Puraskar ( GGPP ) to celebrate innovative panchayats and encourage more innovation in local governance throughout the country .

Of the approximately 60 wastewater and faecal sludge treatment plants that exist in the country , less than half have any functional capacity , and fewer than five are operating as designed . The absence of adequate sewage collection and treatment imparts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ghanas urban areas where the risk of epidemics is highest given the large number of people in a confined area . <p> One of the pathways with highest risk of disease transmission is the widespread consumption of raw vegetables irrigated with surface water which is heavily polluted with excreta related pathogens . Over 200,000 people eat such dishes every day in the Accra fast food sector . While most local consumers might have a higher resistance to the diarrhea causing-rotavirus than Ghanas average tourists , there is no resistance when it comes to cholera , as the current outbreak in Zimbabwe shows . <p> Most sanitation models are imported from the developed world and seldom fit the conditions and capacities in low-income countries which explains the catastrophic statistics given above - and jeopardizes their purpose of safeguarding public health . Until this situation changes , it may make sense to challenge the traditional approach and outsource some sanitation-related public services from the financially constrained public sector to those who benefit from the waste stream , like farmers and vegetable sellers . The IWMI works with the World Health Organization and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health risks on farms and in the street food sector where most dishes with raw vegetables are sold . Some of these findings are summarized in videos we 've posted on YouTube . <p> With the support of Google.org and Canada 's International Development Research Council , an international expert group brainstormed under the leadership of IWMI the about research needs to address the health risks in such situations where public sanitation services are constrained . The meeting concluded with the Accra Consensus and a renewed commitment to " rethink " sanitation . We hope you will share your thoughts on this challenge with us after viewing the videos and reading the Accra Consensus document . <h> 12/03/2008 10:09:00 AM <p> Our Predict and Prevent initiative is delighted to announce support to a new regional disease surveillance network called the Southern African Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance ( SACIDS ) .

As a Google volunteer , I had an opportunity to interact with this years participants by teaching a class on presentation skills , judging the final round of the competition , and conducting one on one consulting sessions . I also visited the growing operations of 3 winners from last year and saw firsthand how the Believe Begin Become program has contributed to the success of their business . <p> I was both impressed and humbled by every entrepreneur I met . They all exhibited a level of energy , passion and enthusiasm that was overwhelmingly contagious . Operating in an environment where sound infrastructure is not a given , poverty is a reality , and health issues abound , they are seeking to create and build sustainable businesses that will change their community and their country for the better . <p> This years top winner of the overall business plan competition , Sheila Ocansey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , embodies this energy and passion . With FrutyFresh , she plans to package and distribute quality fresh fruit to local Ghanaian professionals , families , and children . Sheila was thoughtful enough to bring a sample of her product to her oral presentation , something that impressed all of the judges . I craved FrutyFresh fruit for its freshness , quality , and taste throughout the rest of my stay in Ghana . The other top winners include : Darko Abednego , Stanley Adjei , Yaw Agyei-Henaku , Joseph Brenyah , Savior Deikumah , Nikoe Gavu , Mary Koranteng , Daniel Oduro , and Joseph Tettey . <p> I observed firsthand the promise of what is possible for this years winners through visits with three winners from last year . Nicholas Vordzgbe of City Wash launched his mobile car wash service using a highly profitable , environmentally friendly approach to a common activity . City Wash is capable of washing an SUV with just 2 liters of water ! His next move includes opening a point of service location and expanding his mobile activities . Isaac Bohulu launched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Finally , last years overall winner , Joseph Tackie of MeatyFoods , showed us how a shift in his marketing strategy allowed him to quintuple his revenues in one month . While we sampled the butchers spicy sausage , he told us of his plans to open his second store . <p> The Believe Begin Become program was launched with the hope that we would create an ecosystem of entrepreneurs , investors , customers , and employees that contribute to the growth and economic development of Ghana . Participating in the judging process , seeing the operations in action , and spending time with the entrepreneurs provided evidence that this is exactly what is happening . Participants from last year have become customers and/or suppliers of each other . Last years winner was a mentor to at least 3 of the winners from this year . The judges and potential investors have high standards ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are personally engaged and interested in their success .
