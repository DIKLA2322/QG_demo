@@13269119 @1869119/ <h> Tuesday 11/12/2013 10:17:00 AM <p> We 've launched several tools , available on our Typhoon Yolanda crisis page , to help gather and relay information in connection with the incredible devastation that 's occurred in the Philippines . <p> These resources include Google Person Finder , a web application that allows individuals to post and search for the status of family or friends affected by the disaster . If you 're worried about someone , then click on " I 'm Looking for Someone " and type in their name . If you want to let people know you 're safe or have heard from someone in the area , then click on " I have information about someone " and put in their names and details . As the number of names and records build , the tool will hopefully make it easier for those who are safe to pass on their news to anyone worried about them . <p> We 've also made Person Finder available on mobile phones . You can request status via SMS by sending an SMS to 2662999 ( Globe subscribers ) , 4664999 ( SMART subscribers ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the message " Search " and then the persons name . For example , if you are searching for Joshua Reyes , send the message " Search Joshua Reyes " . <p> These tools are open to anyone to embed on their Web sites - here are instructions for embedding person finder , and you can click the " Share " button at the top of the crisis map to embed or share by email or social media . <p> The more people who contribute to them , the more useful theyll be . <p> Update November 12 : we 're also providing $500,000 , split between two organizations working on the ground , CARE and the Philippine Red Cross , to aid with relief efforts . If you would like to make a donation , we 've provided links to these and other organizations on our crisis landing page .
@@13269120 @1869120/ <h> Wednesday 10/01/2008 10:33:00 AM <p> Right now the U.S. has a very real opportunity to transform our economy from one running on fossil fuels to one largely based on clean energy . We are developing the technologies and know-how to accomplish this . We can build whole new industries and create millions of new jobs . We can reduce energy costs , both at the gas pump and at home . We can improve our national security . And we can put a big dent in climate change . With strong leadership we could be moving forward on an aggressive but realistic timeline and an approach that balances costs with real economic gains . <p> The energy team at Google has been crunching the numbers to see how we could greatly reduce fossil fuel use by 2030 . Our analysis , led by Jeffery Greenblatt , suggests a potential path to weaning the U.S. off of coal and oil for electricity generation by 2030 ( with some remaining use of natural gas as well as nuclear ) , and cutting oil use for cars by 40% . Al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , getting us to carbon-free electricity even sooner . We hope the American public pushes our leaders to embrace it . T. Boone Pickens has weighed in with an interesting plan of his own to massively deploy wind energy , among other things . Other plans have also been developed in recent years that merit attention . <p> Our goal in presenting this first iteration of the Clean Energy 2030 proposal is to stimulate debate and we invite you to take a look and comment - or offer an alternative approach if you disagree . With a new Administration and Congress - and multiple energy-related imperatives - this is an opportune , perhaps unprecedented , moment to move from plan to action . <p> Over 22 years this plan could generate billions of dollars in savings and help create millions of green jobs . Many of these high quality , good-paying jobs will be in today 's coal and oil producing states . <p> To get there we need immediate action on three fronts : <p> ( 1 ) Reduce demand by doing more with less <p> We should start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiency -- adopting technologies and practices that allow us to do more with less . At Google , we 've seen the benefits of this approach . We identified $5M in building efficiency investments with a 2.5 year payback . We 've also designed our own data centers to run more efficiently , and we believe they are the most efficient in the world . On a smaller scale , personal computers can also become much more efficient . A typical desktop PC wastes nearly half the power it consumes . Last year , Bill Weihl , our Green Energy Czar , worked with industry partners to create the Climate Savers Computing Initiative to raise energy efficiency standards for personal computers and servers . If we meet our goals , these standards will cut energy consumption by the equivalent of 10-20 coal-fired power plants by 2010 . <p> Government can have a big impact on achieving greater efficiency . California 's aggressive building codes , efficiency standards and utility programs have helped the state keep per-capita energy use flat for years , while consumption in much of the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national level would help even more . <p> We also need to give the American people opportunities to be more efficient . The way we buy electricity today is like going to a store without seeing prices : we pick what we want , and receive an unintelligible bill at the end of the month . When homes are equipped with smart meters and real-time pricing , research shows that energy use typically drops . Google is looking at ways that we can use our information technology and our reach to help increase awareness and bring better , real-time information to consumers . <p> ( 2 ) Develop renewable energy that is cheaper than coal ( RE&lt;C ) <p> Googles data centers draw from a U.S. electricity grid that relies on coal for 50% of its power . We want to help catalyze the development of renewable energy that is price competitive with coal . At least three technologies show tremendous promise : wind , solar thermal , and advanced geothermal . Each of these is abundant and , when combined , could supply energy in virtually every region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $45 million in startup companies with breakthrough wind , solar and geothermal technologies through our Renewable Energy Cheaper than Coal ( RE&lt;C ) initiative , but that is a drop when we need a flood . We need to unleash massive private investment in clean energy . The government can have a big impact here as well . We must dramatically increase federal R&amp;D and enact measures supporting the rapid deployment and scaling of clean technologies such as long-term tax support and a national renewable energy standard . Tax credits for wind and solar have lapsed several times in the last 20 years , starving these nascent industries of the capital they need to truly enter the mainstream . <p> We also must work both sides of the RE&lt;C equation . Progress will be accelerated when the price of carbon reflects its true costs to society . Putting a price on carbon through cap-and-trade or a carbon tax would help address this . <p> ( 3 ) Electrify transportation and re-invent our electric grid <p> Imagine driving a car that uses no gas and is less expensive to recharge than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to charge when electricity is cheap , and maybe even make some money by selling unused power back to the grid when it 's needed . Plug-in cars are on their way , with GM , Toyota and other manufacturers planning introductions in the next two years . At Google we have a small fleet of Toyota Prius and Ford Escape plug-in conversions , as a part of our RechargeIT program . The converted Prius plug-ins get over 90 MPG , and the Escapes close to 50 MPG . However to successfully put millions of plug-in cars on the road and and fuel them with green electricity , we need a smart grid that manages when we charge and how we 're billed . A smart grid could also provide for the two-way flow of electricity , as well as large-scale integration of intermittent solar and wind energy . Much of the technology in our current electrical grid was developed in the 60s and is wasteful and not very smart . We are partnering with GE to help accelerate the development of the smart grid and support building new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources . <p> We see a huge opportunity for the nation to confront our energy challenges . In the process we will stimulate investment , create jobs , empower consumers and , by the way , help address climate change .
@@13269121 @1869121/ <h> Monday 5/03/2010 11:02:00 AM <p> ( Cross-posted from the Official Google Blog to bring you information on other green efforts at Google ) <p> On Friday we made our first direct investment in a utility-scale renewable energy project two wind farms that generate 169.5 megawatts of power , enough to power more than 55,000 homes . These wind farms , developed by NextEra Energy Resources , harness power from one of the worlds richest wind resources in the North Dakota plains and use existing transmission capacity to deliver clean energy to the region , reducing the use of fossil fuels . Through this $38.8 million investment , were aiming to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy in a way that makes good business sense , too . <p> To reach a clean energy future , we need three things : effective policy , innovative technology and smart capital . Through our philanthropic arm Google.org , we 've been pushing for energy policies that strengthen the innovation pipeline , and we 've been dedicating resources to developing new technologies , including making investments in early-stage renewable energy companies such as eSolar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company investments , but also dedicated funding for utility-scale projects . To tackle this need , we 've been looking at investments in renewable energy projects , like the one we just signed , that can accelerate the deployment of the latest clean energy technology while providing attractive returns to Google and more capital for developers to build additional projects . <p> A clear windy day at the Ashtabula II wind farm <p> Were excited about this first project investment because it uses some of the latest wind turbine technology and control systems to provide one of the lowest-cost sources of renewable energy to the local grid . The turbines can continuously adjust the individual blade pitch angles to achieve optimal efficiency and use larger blades with 15 percent more swept area than earlier generations , allowing capture of even more wind energy for each turbine . The control systems for these wind farms are also advanced and dynamic , allowing for remote 24/7 monitoring and operation to ensure maximum turbine up-time and power production . A couple of us got a chance to climb 80 meters up one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes through a gearbox to turn the generator that makes the electricity . The climb to the top also provided a great view of the entire wind farm ( do n't  worry we all had harnesses and turned the turbine off ! ) . <p> My colleague Matt takes a rest after the 80-meter climb <p> We look forward to finding more opportunities to invest in renewable energy projects that use the latest technologies to push the envelope for delivering low cost clean energy . Well let you know what we find .
