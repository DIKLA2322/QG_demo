@@13269112 @1869112/ <h> Wednesday 10/15/2008 01:45:00 PM <p> Today is Blog Action Day , an annual event that rallies blogs around the world to post about a common cause . This year 's issue up for discussion is poverty , so we wanted to take a look at the relationship between access to information and social and economic development . The right information at the right time in the hands of people has enormous power . As someone who works for Google , I see evidence of this everyday as people search and find information they need to create knowledge , grow their business , or access essential services . But that applies primarily to the rich world , where economies are built on knowledge and presume access to information . What about the poor and developing countries where people are offline more than online ? How do they benefit from the power of information ? <p> In much of Sub-Saharan Africa , for example , rates of economic growth over the last decade have exceeded 5% every year . Despite this trend , poverty in many countries has remained constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate was 48% in 1981 . According to the Kenya Poverty and Inequality Assessment released by the World Bank this year , 17 million Kenyans or 47% of the population were unable to meet the costs of food sufficient to fulfill basic daily caloric requirements . The vast majority of these people live in rural areas and have even less access to the information that impacts their daily life . Data on water quality , education and health budgets , and agricultural prices are nearly impossible to access . <p> Despite hundreds of millions of dollars spent each year on providing basic public services like primary education , health , water , and sanitation to poor communities , poverty in much of Sub-Saharan Africa persists . Where does this money go , who gets it , and what are the results of the resources invested ? That 's where we find a big black hole of information and a lack of basic accountability . How do inputs ( dollars spent ) turn into outputs ( schools , clinics , and wells ) , and , more importantly , how do outputs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , etc . ) ? <p> We simply do n't  know the answers to most of these basic questions . But what if we could ? What if a mother could find out how much money was budgeted for her daughter 's school each year and how much of it was received ? What if she and other parents could report how often teachers are absent from school or whether health clinics have the medicines they are supposed to carry ? What if citizens could access and report on basic information to determine value for money as tax payers ? <p> The work of SODNET in Kenya is illustrative . They are developing a simple budget-tracking tool that allows citizens to track the allocation , use , and ultimate result of government funds earmarked for infrastructure projects in their districts . The tool is intended to create transparency in the use of tax revenues and answer the simple question : Are resources reaching their intended beneficiaries ? Using tools like maps , they are able to overlay information that begins to tell a compelling story . <p> Google.orgs role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to support , catalyze , and widely disseminate this kind of information to public , private , and civil society stakeholders that can use it to see more clearly what 's working , what 's broken and what are potential solutions . Leveraging platforms like Google Earth and Google Maps can help organizations disseminate their content widely and let people see and understand what was once invisible . Once information is visible , widely known , and easy to understand , we are betting that governments and citizens will pay more attention to leakages in the service delivery pipeline and feel empowered to propose solutions . <p> You ca n't change what you cant see . The power to know plus the power to act on what you know is the surest way to achieve positive social change from the bottom up . And when we consider the magnitude of resources invested in delivering public services each year , a 10% improvement globally would exceed the value of all foreign aid . We believe that is a bet worth making .
