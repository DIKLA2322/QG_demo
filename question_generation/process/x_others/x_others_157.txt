@@13269060 @1869060/ <h> Thursday 12/15/2011 10:25:00 AM <p> One of the things I enjoy most about working on Googles green team is understanding what gets people interested in green topics . One way to uncover that is to look at the most popular searches . This years Zeitgeist , released today , highlights the fastest rising searches in 2011 and includes several categories related to the environment . <p> To explore top green searches in the US in the Zeitgeist , you can find lists in the Science , Tech &amp; Gadgets , and Quirky categories . The lists include top searches in alternative energy , rare wild animals , hybrid and alternative vehicles , environmental questions , what people are reusing , quirky environmental , waste disposal , and sustainability . <p> As part of Google Green , we created the Green Scrapbook so you can explore these green trends , choose your favorites , and reveal videos and surprising facts about them . As you click around , you create your very own 2011 Green Scrapbook , which you can personalize with your name on top and share with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wednesday 12/14/2011 07:57:00 AM <p> As the holiday season approaches we thought it was a good moment to update you on some grants we 're making to support education , technology and the fight against modern day slavery . <p> STEM and girls educationScience , technology , engineering and math ( STEM ) open up great opportunities for young people so we 've decided to fund 16 great programs in this area . These include Boston-based Citizen Schools and Generating Genius in the U.K. , both of which work to help to expand the horizons of underprivileged youngsters . In total , our grants will provide enhanced STEM education for more than 3 million students . <p> In addition , we 're supporting girls education in the developing world . By giving a girl an education , you not only improve her opportunities , but those of her whole family . The African Leadership Academy provides merit scholarships to promising young women across the continent , and the Afghan Institute of Learning offers literacy classes to women and girls in rural Afghanistan . Groups like these will use our funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Empowerment through technologyWe 've all been wowed by the entrepreneurial spirit behind the 15 awards in this category , all of whom are using the web , open source programming and other technology platforms to connect communities and improve access to information . Vittana , for instance , helps lenders offer loans to students in the developing world who have have a 99 percent repayment ratepotentially doubling or tripling a recipient 's earning power . Code for America enables the web industry to share its skills with the public sector by developing projects that improve transparency and encourage civic engagement on a mass scale . And Switchboard is working with local mobile providers to help African health care workers create networks and communicate for free . <p> To learn more about these organizations and how you can get involved , visit our Google Gives Back 2011 site and take a look at this video : <p> These grants , which total $40 million , are only part of our annual philanthropic efforts . Over the course of the year , Google provided more than $115 million in funding to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our in-kind support ( programs like Google Grants and Google Apps for Education that offer free products and services to eligible organizations ) came to more than $1 billion , and our annual company-wide GoogleServe event and related programs enabled individual Googlers to donate more than 40,000 hours of their own volunteer time . <p> As 2011 draws to a close , I 'm inspired by this years grantees and look forward to seeing their world-changing work in 2012. <h> 12/07/2011 06:00:00 AM <p> Weve been thrilled to see the ways nonprofit organizations use Google+ to raise awareness about their work , as well as the ways people connect with causes on Google+ . In the past couple days , several entertainers have helped start a movement for this holiday season , drawing attention to their favorite charities on Google+ using the phrase #CauseILoveEm and creatively showing their followers what they love about these nonprofit organizations . <p> +Usher and student participants in his New Look Leadership Academy asked people to do an international act of kindness and post descriptions of their acts including photos and videos as comments on +Usher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " +1 " s will be re-posted by Usher and highlighted on the New Look Foundation website . <p> +Linkin Park posted a new video asking people to spread about the word about +Music For Relief and their new Power the World Give Light campaign , which encourages people to donate to provide solar-powered light bulbs for families in Haiti without electricity . People who share their website online and drive the most clicks will be eligible to win prizes . <p> Co-founder +Hugh Jackman and +Laughing Man Coffee &amp; Tea asked people to share photos of themselves with Laughing Man 's fair trade products ( the profits of which go to charity ) and to sound off on living their motto , " All Be Happy , " using #CauseILoveEm to be included in a thank you photo album . <p> +Find Your Light Foundation and +Josh Groban announced the Fulfill-a-Wish campaign , spotlighting the needs of nonprofit arts organizations from across North America in videos and posts , and asking for your help fulfilling these holiday wishes . <p> We hope you 'll join these folks and lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their favorite nonprofits this holiday season . Say which nonprofit you like and what you like about them in a public post using the phrase #CauseILoveEm and mentioning the nonprofits Google+ page by typing " + " and the nonprofits name . Be creative and post videos , images and stories that will convince others to love them too . Through the end of December on our +Google for Nonprofits page , well re-share great examples of the ways people are recognizing their favorite nonprofits and highlight some nonprofits with which you might want to connect . <p> If the nonprofit you care about most is n't yet on Google+ , be sure to let them know about our Google+ for Nonprofit community page that they can use to get started and learn more . Thanks in advance for caring about these organizations and doing something small to help them grow and achieve their goals during the holiday season .
