@@13268813 @1868813/ <p> Too many students , though , still are n't acquiring basic skills . Some 130 million children complete four years of school without learning to read or add and subtract . In India , for instance , roughly half of all 5th grade children ca n't read a second grade text or perform a two-digit subtraction problem . In Brazil , only one in ten high-school graduates performs at grade level in math . <p> These gaps in student learning , which are reflected in places all around the world , stem from a host of challenges : students lacking materials at their reading level or in their mother tongue ; teachers who lack the tools they need to succeed ; and kids who ca n't get to school because they 're stuck in a conflict zone , to name just a few . <p> Google has long believed that technology has a vital role to play in tackling these and other educational challenges ; it can get more books to students , more lesson plans to teachers , and classrooms to kids who ca n't get there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in access and opportunity . In prosperous communities , the internet delivers ever-richer learning experiences . But as children in this wired world enjoy online videos , digital tutors and virtual reality , less fortunate students all around the globe are falling ever further behind . <p> At Google.org , our approach to education is to find the most promising nonprofits and put the best of Google " our philanthropy , our people , our products " to work helping them close this worldwide gap in learning and academic opportunity . <h> Philanthropy , the Google way <p> In 2016 Google.org launched a new initiative to give $50 million to organizations that are using technology to solve some of the trickiest parts of this problem in a scalable way . <p> Google has never taken a conventional approach to solving problems , and neither does Google.org . When we support an organization , we commit more than just our funding " we bring these grantees into the company and give them access to our best thinkers . Google engineers volunteer their skills and time to help our grantees take their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tools help them scale solutions . And , always , we share what we learn with the rest of the nonprofit sector ; we believe technology solutions that can help anyone ought to belong to everyone . <p> We 're not looking to help nonprofits go from x to x+1 . We want them to get to x squared . <p> Jacquelline Fuller , Director of Google.org <p> Our education grants will focus on three areas where technology can help : giving more students access to quality learning materials , supporting teacher development , and reaching students in conflict zones . <h> 1 . Giving kids the right materials <p> Around the world , students in low-income communities have to learn with less : fewer books , out-of-date texts , and materials that are culturally irrelevant or even in the wrong language . Technology can bypass the geographic and financial boundaries that can block educational resources from reaching students , while also making those resources more engaging , interactive , and effective . <p> One of our first grantees in this area is the Foundation for Learning Equality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " including books , video tutorials , quizzes " to the 4.3 billion people who lack consistent access to the internet . Their new platform , Kolibri , runs on numerous devices , from repurposed desktop computers to low-cost , off-the-shelf file storage drives , and helps educators access , organize , and customize digital content , even in the most remote locations . So far they 've brought 7,000 videos and 26,000 interactive exercises offline for students in about 160 countries . <p> Our funding , along with Google volunteers providing technical support , will help Learning Equality build a bigger content library and scale their reach to hundreds of thousands of new students . This summer , Google engineers and product experts are volunteering to spend four weeks working side-by-side with Learning Equality 's product team in areas such as UX/UI , content integration , and video compression technology . <h> 2 . Keeping teachers trained and engaged <p> It 's no surprise that having a great teacher is one of the best predictors of a student 's academic success . In many countries there simply are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need 3 million new primary school teachers just to keep up with its growing population of students . <p> But great teaching is n't just a numbers game ; too often , teachers are burdened with large class sizes , infrequent training , rigid , creativity-stifling curricula , and even simple isolation . <p> Teaching is a lonely profession . You go into a class and no one sees you . There 's a community of teachers out there , but it 's hard to reach them . <p> Abhinav Mathur , engineer and cofounder of Million Sparks Foundation <p> Technology can make it easier . Google.org is helping local leaders invest in digital tools that offer teachers quality training and confidence-building tools that encourage creativity in the classroom . The first of these grants goes to Million Sparks Foundation 's ChalkLit , an app-based platform that combines bite-sized , curriculum-aligned content with online community to support high-caliber teachers and promote first-rate teaching . Google engineers volunteering their time and skills will advise the Million Sparks team on how to optimize the ChalkLit app for use by teachers in low-bandwidth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in crisis <p> While more children than ever are attending school , 32 million primary school-aged students ca n't reach traditional classrooms because of violent conflict and displacement . Quality primary education is especially important to kids who , living in camps or other hard-to-reach settings , are highly vulnerable to poverty and exploitative labor . <p> One interesting approach to this problem comes from Google.org grantee War Child Holland , whose game-based method , Ca n't Wait To Learn , helps keep displaced children from falling behind by reaching them with a full year of lessons and exercises that align with a host country 's curriculum . <p> Data collected from Ca n't Wait To Learn 's first deployments in Sudan showed students significantly learning from the game , with boys and girls gaining equally and those who knew the least , learning the most . Supported by Google product experts who are volunteering to help them build their product road map and expand their tech team , War Child Holland aims to reach a million students in the next five years . <h> Launch , iterate , measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed and guaranteed to succeed . Our initiatives are carefully considered bets on seasoned innovators , and we plan to measure our progress to inform our work 's trajectory , and share our results to ensure that everyone can learn along with us . <p> Stay tuned for updates about our success and lessons learned along the way .
