@@13268930 @1868930/ <h> Wednesday 7/09/2008 09:45:00 AM <p> I recently returned from a research trip across four East African countries . Every time I return from the region , I am energized by the dynamism of the young people I meet but overwhelmed by the challenges the region faces . The combination of high oil and food prices affects the United States economy , to be sure , but the impact on poor people in poor countries is exponentially greater . People have to make hard decisions like taking their children out of school , rationing the little food they have , and in some cases not eating at all . High fuel prices also contribute to lower uses of fertilizer , resulting in lower agricultural yields . The cycle spirals in a way that hurts the poorest people the most . <p> And yet there is another story unfolding simultaneously in Eastern Africa . It is the story of Safaricom , the most successful telecom company on the continent . Safaricom started trading publicly on the Nairobi stock exchange in June and catalyzed the largest IPO on the continent ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all walks of life , resulting in an over-subscription of stock of more than 400% . Mobile is growing faster in Africa than in any other part of the world . While levels of internet penetration are well below 5% for the continent , nearly 40% have access to mobile phones and Nairobi sends more text messages in a single day than New York ( a statistic frequently quoted in the region ) . <p> Ten years ago people were talking about land lines and how they would ever penetrate rural Africa . Infrastructure has long been a constraint on economic development and growth in Africa but nobody imagined that a new technology would completely leap-frog the traditional phone and fundamentally disrupt telephony in Africa . I ca n't help but think about rural energy in the same light . Today , countries like Uganda are still 90% unserved by electricity . Can you imagine not having power in 90% of any country and still trying to grow the economy ? Do we expect Africans to wait for grid electricity to incrementally reach people or are there disruptive innovations that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways ? What would this look like given large geo-thermal and bio-diesel reserves in East Africa and can renewable energy sources provide opportunities for greener solutions in Africa ? <p> Interacting with dynamic and bright Africans under 30 ( who make up 70% or more of most African countries ) , I can not help but wonder what is on the horizon . People are innovating all over the continent with bio-gas , small scale hydro , wind , and solar power . Where people have electricity , there is a massive difference in economic activity , public services , productivity , and hope about the future . Energy is truly a platform that affects nearly every aspect of rural life . Today , Africa is mostly unserved by power grids but given innovation possibilities , are there not scalable ways to introduce renewable energy to millions of people who are completely unplugged from the global economy today ?
