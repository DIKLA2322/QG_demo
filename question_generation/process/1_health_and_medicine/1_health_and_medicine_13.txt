Determine whether to reinfuse.
(iv) Immunotherapy.
1. Glucocorticoids. For heavy and critically ill patients with progressive deterioration of oxygenation index, rapid imaging progress, and over-activation of the organism's inflammatory response, use glucocorticosteroids for a short period of time (no more than 10 days) as appropriate, recommending dexamethasone 5 mg/day or methylprednisolone 40 mg/day, and avoiding prolonged and high doses of glucocorticosteroids to reduce side effects.
2. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) inhibitor: tolimumab. It can be tried in heavy and critical cases with elevated IL-6 levels in laboratory tests. Dosage: First dose 4-8mg/kg, recommended dose 400mg, saline diluted to 100ml, infusion time >1 hour; if the first dose is not effective, the first dose can be applied in 12 hours.
The maximum number of doses should not exceed 800 mg.
(v) Anticoagulation therapy.
For patients with high risk factors for severe disease and rapid disease progression in the general, heavy and critical categories, therapeutic doses of low molecular heparin or normal heparin may be given in the absence of contraindications. In case of thromboembolic events, treat according to the appropriate guidelines.
(vi) Prone position treatment.
Patients with high risk factors for severe disease and rapid progression in the general, heavy and critical categories should be treated in a standardized prone position for a minimum of 12 hours per day.
(vii) Psychological intervention.
Patients often suffer from stress and anxiety and should receive psychological support and, if necessary, medication.
