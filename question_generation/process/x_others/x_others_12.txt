@@13268898 @1868898/ <p> In the long run , cheap grid-scale electricity storage can create large economic and environmental benefits for the US . It improves power quality and reliability , lowers power prices by allowing more efficient dispatch , and enables much higher penetrations of intermittent solar and wind than would otherwise be possible . Our modeling indicates that grid storage , when combined with breakthroughs in solar and wind could increase renewables deployment by up to 35% by 2050 . <p> In the short term , much cheaper storage , absent innovations in wind and solar that reduce their cost to below coal , could actually drive an increase in coal consumption . Cheaper storage would enable already cheap coal units to run at peak efficiency 24 hours/day , store energy at night and dispatch it during the day -- reducing the demand for load-following natural gas capacity and ultimately resulting in a slight ( 0.3% ) increase in greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions .

For our children and grandchildren , climate change is an issue of public health , economics , global security and social equity . This human side of climate change is explained in a new Google Earth tour narrated by former U.N . Secretary General Kofi Annan . Within these stories , you 'll find data and tools to explore this topic in more depth , and meet some of the people who are actively working on managing the risks of climate variability and change . We encourage you to take the tour to learn more about these human issues and the inspiring work of groups like the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa ( AGRA ) that are helping farmers cope with climate change . We hope this video will serve as a useful tool as educators help students around the world understand the complexity of this issue . <p> This is the latest in our series of climate change tours that were releasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Climate Change ( COP16 ) talks in Cancun , Mexico this week . <p> As part of the Google Earth for Educators Community , weve also created a special Climate Change Educators Resources page that teachers can use in their classrooms . Here , teachers can find the tools they need to create lesson plans about climate change , including all the individual Google Earth KML layers available for download . Teachers and students can overlay multiple data layers that help illustrate climate change , and discuss and analyze them as part of K-12 and higher education curriculum . Were also looking for lessons plans for any school grade that use this narrated tour or these Google Earth KML layers , so if you 're a teacher or instructor , please submit your lesson plan for review now .

At that time we announced a request for investment proposals ( RFP ) from teams working on technologies relevant to this goal . Today we are pleased to announce our first RechargeIT investments in two promising companies tackling the challenge of vehicle electrification.Aptera Motors of Carlsbad , California is building an ultra-high efficiency vehicle based on improved aerodynamics and composite materials . Aptera 's first prototype achieved over 230 miles per gallon during testing , and they are developing an all-electric as well as a plug-in hybrid vehicle based on this design . <p> ActaCell is an Austin-based company working to commercialize lithium-ion battery technology developed at the University of Texas at Austin . ActaCell 's technology offers the promise of improved battery cycle life and lower costs , while maintaining a focus on battery safety , all of which are important factors in the widespread adoption of plug-in vehicles . <p> Both of these innovative companies and their capable teams are working to develop technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : millions of plug-in vehicles on the road .
