@@13268812 @1868812/ <h> FAQ <h> What is Earth Engine ? <p> Earth Engine is a platform for petabyte-scale scientific analysis and visualization of geospatial datasets , both for public benefit and for business and government users . <p> Earth Engine stores satellite imagery , organizes it , and makes it available for the first time for global-scale data mining . The public data archive includes historical earth imagery going back more than forty years , and new imagery is collected every day . Earth Engine also provides APIs in JavaScript and Python , as well as other tools , to enable the analysis of large datasets . <h> How is Earth Engine different from Google Earth ? <p> Earth Engine and Google Earth serve different purposes . Google Earth enables you to travel and learn about the world through a virtual globe . You can view satellite imagery , maps , terrain , 3D buildings and much more . Earth Engine , on the other hand , is a tool for analyzing geospatial information . Although Earth Engine has a data catalog , not everything available in Google Earth is available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of the data in Earth Engine is not currently available for visualization in Google Earth . <h> Why is Google working on Earth Engine ? <p> Google 's mission is to organize the world 's information and make it universally accessible and useful . In line with this mission , Earth Engine organizes geospatial information and makes it available for analysis . More generally , Google strives to make the world a better place through the use of technology . Earth Engine 's technical infrastructure powers humanitarian , scientific , and environmental initiatives which Google is proud to support . <h> How do I get access ? <p> To get access to the advanced features of Earth Engine , please fill out the form at https : **31;67;TOOLONG . We are not accepting all applications , so please fill out all fields as best you can so we can evaluate your request for access . <p> If you are accepted , you will receive an email titled " Google Groups : You 've been added to **27;100;TOOLONG " within one week of applying . Please read that email , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get access . <h> Is Earth Engine available for commercial use ? <p> Earth Engine 's terms allow for use in development , evaluation , research , and education environments . It may be evaluated in a commercial or operational environment but use is not allowed for sustained production use , and data products generated by Earth Engine may not be sold . However , we do have a commercial license program , so if you are interested in pursuing a commercial application of our product , please contact us at **33;129;TOOLONG . <h> Who uses Earth Engine , what are some examples of how it 's being used ? <p> Earth Engine is used by researchers , nonprofits , educators , and governmental agencies who use the system to analyze large scale geospatial data . Please refer to our Case Studies for examples of how Earth Engine is being used . <h> How does Earth Engine compare to the Landsat and Sentinel data in Google Cloud ? <p> The Earth Engine team has worked in close collaboration with Google Cloud to bring the Landsat and Sentinel-2 collections to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The collections in Google Cloud are best suited to workflows where you need to access the data directly from Cloud services such as Google Compute Engine or Google Cloud Machine Learning . The Earth Engine Code Editor and the Earth Engine API do not access these Cloud collections but instead use the Earth Engine data catalog directly . <h> Can I use my own proprietary imagery and vector data ? <h> Must I display my Earth Engine results on a Google Map ? <p> You are free to display Earth Engine results in any mapping platform . <h> Can I share the results of my analysis ? <p> We encourage Earth Engine users to share the results . Results and analysis scripts may be shared directly with other Earth Engine users through Earth Engine tools , or may be downloaded and shared like any other data . <h> Who owns the algorithms I write in Earth Engine and the results of my analyses ? <p> You do . The results of all analyses you perform are yours . All algorithms that you write with our API are yours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support do you offer ? <p> Once you have been given access to Earth Engine , you may join our Developers list where Earth Engine staff and other Earth Engine users answer questions about each other 's scripts . Approximately once a year , generally in early December , we open up the Earth Engine Research Awards for proposals . We do frequent Earth Engine trainings , which are typically announced on the Developer 's list , as well as through the Google Earth Outreach mailing list . These include the annual Earth Engine User Summit and the Geo for Good conference , typically held at the Googleplex in Mountain View , CA.
