@@13268939 @1868939/ <h> Thursday 12/02/2010 08:00:00 AM <p> Today , we launched a new Google Labs product called Google Earth Engine at the International Climate Change Conference in sunny Cancun , Mexico . Google Earth Engine is a new technology platform that puts an unprecedented amount of satellite imagery and datacurrent and historicalonline for the first time . It enables global-scale monitoring and measurement of changes in the earths environment . The platform will enable scientists to use our extensive computing infrastructurethe Google " cloud " to analyze this imagery . Last year , we demonstrated an early prototype . Since then , we have developed the platform , and are excited now to offer scientists around the world access to Earth Engine to implement their applications . <p> Why is this important ? The images of our planet from space contain a wealth of information , ready to be extracted and applied to many societal challenges . Scientific analysis can transform these images from a mere set of pixels into useful informationsuch as the locations and extent of global forests , detecting how our forests are changing over time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The challenge has been to cope with the massive scale of satellite imagery archives , and the computational resources required for their analysis . As a result , many of these images have never been seen , much less analyzed . Now , scientists will be able to build applications to mine this treasure trove of data on Google Earth Engine , providing several advantages : <p> Landsat satellite data archives over the last 25 years for most of the developing world available online , ready to be used together with other datasets including MODIS . And we will soon offer a complete global archive of Landsat . <p> Reduced time to do analyses , using Googles computing infrastructure . By running analyses across thousands of computers , for example , unthinkable tasks are now possible for the first time . <p> New features that will make analysis easier , such as tools that pre-process the images to remove clouds and haze . <p> Collaboration and standardization by creating a common platform for global data analysis . <p> Google Earth Engine can be used for a wide range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its part of our broader effort at Google to build a more sustainable future . Were particularly excited about an initial use of Google Earth Engine to support development of systems to monitor , report and verify ( MRV ) efforts to stop global deforestation . <p> Deforestation releases a significant amount of carbon into the atmosphere , accounting for 12-18% of annual greenhouse gas emissions . The world loses 32 million acres of tropical forests every year , an area the size of Greece . The United Nations has proposed a framework known as REDD ( Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries ) that would provide financial incentives to tropical nations to protect their forests . Reaching an agreement on early development of REDD is a key agenda item here in Cancun . <p> Today , we announced that we are donating 10 million CPU-hours a year over the next two years on the Google Earth Engine platform , to strengthen the capacity of developing world nations to track the state of their forests , in preparation for REDD . For the least developed nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of data , a growing set of analytical tools and our high-performance processing capabilities . We believe Google Earth Engine will bring transparency and more certainty to global efforts to stop deforestation . <p> Weve been working with several partners to fully develop this platform . In particular , the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation has been a key strategic and funding partner . The Moore Foundation has also committed over $12 million dollars through its Environmental Conservation Program to projects that support the development of Google Earth Engine . The Moore Foundations Environment Program finances practical , enduring solutions to environmental challenges and works to improve the way society uses and manages important terrestrial , freshwater , and coastal marine ecosystems to create working land and seascapes that support resilient and productive ecosystems for current and future generations . Theyve funded the U.S. Geological Survey to scale their infrastructure and accelerate bringing historic Landsat data off tape , and online , through Google Earth Engine . <p> This animation shows the breadth and depth of the Landsat archive that has been uploaded into Google Earth Engine to date . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collaboration . <p> Support from the Moore Foundation includes funding for several scientists to develop and integrate their desktop software to work online with the data available in Google Earth Engine . Those scientists -- Greg Asner of the Carnegie Institution for Science and Carlos Souza of Imazon -- are also key partners , along with Matt Hansen of the Geographic Information Science Center at South Dakota State University . All are at the cutting edge of forest monitoring in support of climate science . <p> In collaboration with Matt Hansen and CONAFOR , Mexicos National Forestry Commission , we 've produced a forest cover and water map of Mexico . This is the finest-scale forest map produced of Mexico to date . The map required 15,000 hours of computation , but was completed in less than a day on Google Earth Engine , using 1,000 computers over more than 53,000 Landsat scenes ( 1984-2010 ) . CONAFOR provided National Forest Inventory ground-sampled data to calibrate and validate the algorithm . <p> A forest cover and water map of Mexico ( southern portion , including the Yucatan peninsula ) , produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We hope that Google Earth Engine will be an important tool to help institutions around the world manage forests more wisely . As we fully develop the platform , we hope more scientists will use new Earth Engine API to integrate their applications onlinefor deforestation , disease mitigation , disaster response , water resource mapping and other beneficial uses . If you 're interested in partnering with us , we want to hear from youvisit our website ! We look forward to seeing what 's possible when scientists , governments , NGOs , universities , and others gain access to data and computing resources to collaborate online to help protect the earths environment . <p> Update on 12/6 : Additional information on the Moore Foundation , Google Earth Engines Landsat archive , and the Congo Basin Water Map have been added to the post .
