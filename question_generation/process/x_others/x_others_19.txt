Dr. Stephen Schneider , a Stanford Professor and a global leader in climate change science died Monday morning of a heart attack . <p> Steve was an important mentor and friend to me , as I know he was to many scientists and activists around the world . For many years I turned to Steve for advice on climate science and insights into the political process . I remember one line he often repeated to me : <p> " Amy , when it comes to climate science , always stick to the facts , the truth is bad enough . " <p> Steve was brilliant at communicating the facts in plain language always driving home the message of risk . Managing climate change was like his struggle with leukemia , it required making decisions with incomplete information to improve the odds that you live a better and longer life . <p> Last year Steve collaborated with us on developing a Google Earth tour that provides a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were putting the final touches on this Google Earth Tour , I asked Steve if he would be at the World Climate Conference in Geneva , hoping we could meet up in person .

When teachers do receive training , it 's often a one-time , disconnected event that does n't bridge the gap between pedagogical theory and day-to-day teaching practice . <p> Tangerine:Tutor , an open-source software platform built by RTI International , attacks this problem by helping teacher coaches in low-resource environments provide targeted guidance that leads to improved student learning .

@@13268927 @1868927/ <h> Monday 2/23/2009 04:17:00 PM <p> When Larry and Sergey laid out their vision for Google.org , they hoped that this " experiment in active philanthropy " would one day have an even greater impact on the world than Google itself . They committed resources from Google 's profits , equity and substantial employee time to this philanthropic effort , and they created the mission : " to use the power of information and technology to address the global challenges of our age . " They structured Google.org so that in addition to traditional grant making , it can also invest in for-profit companies , advocate for policies and , most important , tap into Google 's strengths : its employees , products and technologies . At first I was skeptical about " going corporate , " but I came on board convinced that Google could make real progress on these issues . I think we have made an excellent beginning , but it is just a very few steps on a long path . <p> Now , three years after Google.org was founded , we 've been reviewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's clear that I am most effective in helping to identify " big ideas " and potential partners , as well as raising awareness about society 's biggest challenges . I am therefore very excited to become Google 's Chief Philanthropy Evangelist . I think this is the highest contribution that I can make both to Google.org and to fighting the urgent threats of our day : from climate change to emerging infectious diseases , to issues of poverty and health care . By focusing my energy outwards I hope to be able to spend more time motivating policy makers , encouraging public and private partnerships , and generally advocating for the changes that we must make as a global society to solve these problems . Long-time Googler Megan Smith will take over day-to-day management of Google.org , joining as General Manager to lead us through this transition , in addition to her existing role as Vice President of New Business Development . <p> One of the first things that Megan will focus on is how Google.org can best achieve its mission . During our review it became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkable non-profit organizations over the past three years , our greatest impact has come when we 've attacked problems in ways that make the most of Google 's strengths in technology and information ; examples of this approach include Flu Trends , RechargeIT , Clean Energy 2030 , and PowerMeter . By aligning Google.org more closely with Google as a whole , Megan will ensure that we 're better able to build innovative , scalable technology and information solutions . As a first step , Google has decided to put even more engineers and technical talent to work on these issues and problems , resources which I have found to be extraordinary . In this global economic crisis , the work Google.org is doing , together with our many colleagues around the world , to help develop cheap clean energy , find and fight disease outbreaks before they sweep the globe , and build information platforms for underserved people globally , is more important than ever . We stand behind the commitment made in 2004 to devote 1% of Google 's equity and profits to philanthropy , and we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our resources have the greatest possible impact for good .
