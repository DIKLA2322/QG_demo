@@13269101 @1869101/ <p> The finding indicates that West Virginia potentially holds the highest grade geothermal resources east of the Mississippi River . SMU estimates that 2% of West Virginia 's geothermal resources could support over 18,890 megawatts of electrical generating capacity using Enhanced Geothermal Systems ( EGS ) and other advanced geothermal technologies such as Co-Produced Fluids and Low Temperature Hydrothermal . <p> The SMU team has been developing entirely new pictures of the earth 's geothermal resources . They have started by aggregating thousands of new Bottom Hole Temperature ( BHT ) temperature readings from oil , gas , and water wells in previously under-sampled regions of the U.S. For example , The 2004 Geothermal Map of North America featured only four temperature points informing geothermal estimates for West Virginia , compared to 1,455 points in the updated version . In addition , the team has improved estimates of heat flow through the earth 's crust with better regional lithologic data . The new results indicate the potential for temperatures as high as 200c ( 392 f ) at depths of 5 kilometers ( 16,404 feet ) . <p> SMU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a new map and national resource estimatess . With improvements in EGS technology , these resources can be harnessed to provide clean , reliable , baseload renewable power 24/7/365 . <p> Our congratulations go out to the SMU team for their exiting discovery : Dr. David Blackwell , Maria Richards , Zachary Frone , and Joseph Batir . <p> For more information on Google.org 's geothermal investments and research projects , please visit google.org/egs.
