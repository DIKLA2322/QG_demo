The idea was simple : technology can and should be used for good . RHoK brings together subject matter experts , volunteer software developers and designers to create open source and technology agnostic software solutions that address challenges facing humanity . On June 4-5 , 2011 well hold the third Random Hacks of Kindness global event at five U.S. locations and 13 international sites , giving local developer communities the opportunity to collaborate on problems in person . <p> The RHoK community has already developed some applications focused on crisis response such as ImOK , a mobile messaging application for disaster response that was used on the ground in Haiti and Chile ; and CHASM , a visual tool to map landslide risk currently being piloted by the World Bank in landslide affected areas in the Caribbean . Person Finder , a tool created by Googles crisis response team to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disaster , was also refined at RHoK events and effectively deployed in Haiti , Chile and Japan . <p> Were inviting all developers , designers and anyone else who wants to help " hack for humanity , " to attend one of the local events on June 4-5 . There , you 'll meet other open source developers , work with experts in disaster and climate issues and contribute code to exciting projects that make a difference . If you 're in Northern California , come join us at the Silicon Valley RHoK event at Google headquarters . <p> And if you 're part of an organization that works in the fields of crisis response or climate change , you can submit a problem definition online , so that developers and volunteers can work on developing technology to address the challenge . <p> Visit http : //www.rhok.org/ for more information and to sign up for your local event , and get set to put your hacking skills to good use .
