Here at Google , well be focusing on one of the planets more enjoyable aspects : its food . ( Though , to be fair , were always focused on food around here ) . Our offices are hosting farmers markets , planting herb gardens , hosting talks on sustainable cooking and much more . <p> At our Mountain View headquarters , were enjoying solar cooking demonstrations , classes on composting and local food sourcing , distribution of reusable shopping bags and discussions on healthy cooking and eating . Were also hosting a speaker from The Nature Conservancy and giving tours of our on-site 1.6MW solar panel installation and the 400kW Bloom Energy fuel cells . Today is also Take Your Child to Work Day , so we have plenty of kid-friendly activities centered around healthy , sustainable habits to complement the bounce house , movies and games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mountain View . Our Dublin office is removing all disposable cups , Stockholm is running a special Earth Day food menu in their cafe , Wroclaw employees are planting seeds and Amsterdam is overhauling its salad bar with organic offerings . And the cafe in our London office is sourcing all of its food from within 50 miles of the office , as well as organizing a bike-to-work effort coordinated with Google Maps . <p> Beyond food , we 've been busy with a number of other Earth-related initiatives . Last month , Google Maps biking directions launched in the U.S. and we hope that having these directions on hand will help you find less carbon-intensive ways to commute to work or meet friends . Just the other week we added a new feature in Google Finance that reports companies carbon disclosure rating from the Carbon Disclosure Project . Oh , and do n't  forget about the new kids on the block . <p> If you 're looking to make a difference , check for local efforts or make a pledge to have an impact . Were working to minimize our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today to consider how you can make a positive impact on our planet . <h> 4/15/2010 04:29:00 PM <p> ( Cross-posted from the Official Google Blog to bring you information on other green efforts at Google ) <p> Last year , in our quest to minimize our carbon footprint ( and keep people on their toes ) , we turned to an unlikely solution for mowing an overgrown field : goats . More than 200 goats from California Grazing have once again arrived at our Mountain View headquarters where theyll stay for over a week chomping away on grassy goodness . The cost of bringing in the goats is comparable to hiring lawn mowers for the same job and the green benefits are clear : the goats eliminate mower emissions , reduce noise pollution , restore plant species and fertilize while grazing . <p> Do n't  worry , were not going to be in the business of ch+vre anytime soon , but in the meantime were having a lot of fun watching our new colleagues . <h> 4/15/2010 09:55:00 AM <p> Yesterday , when a powerful earthquake struck the Qinghai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobilized to see how we could help with disaster response . <p> We are working on several tools to help people on the ground find out more information about the earthquake , connect with loved ones , as well as help with recovery efforts . <p> For those concerned about loved ones in Qinghai , the China Person Finder tool can be used to submit or search for information about individuals who may have been affected . The tool is available in Simplified Chinese , Traditional Chinese and English . We encourage organizations and media sites to embed the gadget on their sites and help spread the word . <p> In addition , users can access earthquake information on Google News and Google Maps from a link on our homepages on google.com.hk , and google.com.tw . The site also includes links to real-time search information , which includes peoples posts to Twitter and other sources . <p> We will keep posting updates to the Google China blog as more information and tools become available . Please visit this page for updated resources . <h> Monday 4/05/2010 07:59:00 AM <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to decipher besides the total amount due . What if we instead had access to more useful and actionable information about our energy consumption ? What if consumers could use this information to automatically adjust appliances , lights , and other equipment to save money and cut energy use ? <p> That 's what a group of over 45 major companies and organizations said today in a letter to President Obama . Signers include companies like AT&amp;T , General Electric and Intel and NGOs like The Climate Group , NRDC and the Alliance to Save Energy . The group also includes start ups , smart grid companies , venture firms and trade organizations . <p> This diverse group shares a common vision : giving consumers the ability to monitor and manage their power use will save them energy and money . It will also unleash innovation in homes and businesses as new energy saving technologies and apps are developed . <p> This group will continue to look for ways to offer ideas to policymakers on how to empower consumers with energy saving tools and information . Join the discussion tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and The Climate Group . If you can make it , RSVP here . <h> Friday 4/02/2010 12:22:00 PM <p> The international community likes to define Liberias recent history primarily through two events : its fourteen-year civil war , which ended in 2003 , and the work of the countrys president , Ellen Johnson Sirleaf , the first democratically elected female leader in Africa . The chart below illustrates both . On my recent trip to Liberia , first with a group of Bay Area philanthropists hosted by the government and then as part of a small group of Googlers on a country visit , I learned more about how terrible the 1980s and 90s were in this small West African nation . GDP -- a crude measure of the health of a nation , but an indicator nonetheless -- dropped 90% as the country endured brutal dictatorship after brutal dictatorship . That decline is the largest in any nation since World War II , and nearly twice the percentage drop that Rwanda , Zimbabwe , and other states experienced during their crises . The good news is that although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , GDP has almost risen to pre-conflict levels during Johnson Sirleafs tenure , and foreign direct investment has returned . <p> The numbers also tell a third story . Throughout the 1960s and 70s Liberias economy grew at a steady pace in a way that most other African economies did not . The growth was inequitable -- but real -- and the ingenuity and entrepreneurship that drove it are on full display today , albeit in ways that can sometimes puzzle a visitor to the country . <p> During the ten days I was in Liberia my colleagues and I always had a driver ; its the only way for foreigners to get around . The first day we reserved our car for 9:00am but when I looked out the hotel window at 9:02am I noticed the car speeding off with three other passengers . When I frantically called the driver he responded , " My man , do n't  worry -- I will get you to your meeting on time . " And he did . Then there was the night a local friend suggested dinner by saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outdoor patio at the base of Sniper Hill . . . wait , that did n't  quite sound as inviting as I meant it . " When we arrived our waiter was Frankie , a cheerful eight-year old sporting an Alex Rodriguez Yankees jersey who delivered our food and drink on the jog . At the local family restaurant , everyone pitched in . <p> Like most of Africa , cell phones are ubiquitous in Liberia and are the technology of choice for the vast majority of the population . Our meetings with the mobile providers there could have taken place anywhere in the world . They 're making money but are fiercely competitive with one another , slashing prices and offering new products to gain market share , and desperately trying to expand into new markets like broadband . Their activities are far from philanthropic , but they 're arguably having a more positive affect on Liberians day-to-day life than any other segment of society . The mobile penetration rate is 40% and rising , particularly in rural areas where phones are often the first " big " purchase a Liberian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course noticeable here as well . Liberians will often carry SIM cards from different mobile carriers and switch back and forth depending on coverage and prices ( a noticeably nice option that 's not available in the locked-down U.S. market ) . Since unanswered calls do n't  incur a charge and the person who initiates the call pays more than the receiver , Liberians will also occasionally call and hang up , meaning , " I want talk to you but you can afford this more than I can , so call me back . " Scratch cards , which give you twenty or thirty minutes of talk time , are practically used as cash and are sold virtually everywhere . <p> The past thirty years have been difficult ones for most Liberians , and with an 80% unemployment rate and known war criminals still occupying high government offices , there are still huge problems to address . In the next two years the country will hold elections and most of the UN peacekeepers will withdraw . Watch closely : if both go well , a stable Liberia may finally be back .
