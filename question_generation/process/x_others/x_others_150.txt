As shown in the figure below , Liberia has one of the lowest volumes of Internet traffic per capita in the world , and ranks in the bottom quintile within Africa . <p> Historically constrained by slow and expensive satellite connections for Internet connectivity , the country expects to connect to the ACE submarine cable in 2013 . This international connectivity will enable the deployment of low-cost infrastructure and accelerate the adoption of inexpensive Internet-enabled devices . As such , Liberia has an excellent opportunity to harness the Internet for economic and human development gains over the next few years . <p> At Google.org , we are contributing ideas for Liberias efforts to build Internet capacity , outlined in a white paper , " Best Practices for Liberias Internet Ecosystem . " We outline principles for establishing a strong Internet foundation in Liberia . Suggestions include piggybacking on non-telecom infrastructure investments , creating an Internet exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV white spaces for ISPs . <p> In putting this white paper together , we benefited from the diversity of global challenges that Googlers have experienced when working with networks . The paper also taps into the first-hand knowledge of local stakeholders across public , private , and non-profit sectors . In collaboration with the many complementary players in Liberia , we aim to turn technology opportunity into development progress .
