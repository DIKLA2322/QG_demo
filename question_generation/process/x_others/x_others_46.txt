@@13268908 @1868908/ <h> Tuesday 6/28/2011 07:00:00 AM <p> At Google , were committed to using technology to solve one of the greatest challenges we face as a country : building a clean energy future . That 's why we 've worked hard to be carbon neutral as a company , launched our renewable energy cheaper than coal initiative and have invested in several clean energy companies and projects around the world . <p> But what if we knew the value of innovation in clean energy technologies ? How much could new technologies contribute to our economic growth , enhance our energy security or reduce greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions ? Robust data can help us understand these important questions , and the role innovation in clean energy could play in addressing our future economic , security and climate challenges . <p> Through Google.org , our energy team set out to answer some of these questions . Using McKinseys Low Carbon Economics Tool ( LCET ) , we assessed the long-term economic impacts for the U.S. assuming breakthroughs were made in several different clean energy technologies , like wind , geothermal and electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interlinked models that estimates the potential economic and technology implications of various policy and technology assumptions . <p> The analysis is based on a model and includes assumptions and conclusions that Google.org developed , so it is n't a prediction of the future . Weve decided to make the analysis and associated data available everywhere because we believe it could provide a new perspective on the economic value of public and private investment in energy innovation . Here are just some of the most compelling findings : <p> Energy innovation pays off big : We compared " business as usual " ( BAU ) to scenarios with breakthroughs in clean energy technologies . On top of those , we layered a series of possible clean energy policies ( more details in the report ) . We found that by 2030 , when compared to BAU , breakthroughs could help the U.S. : <p> Reduce U.S. total carbon emissions by 13% in 2030 ( 21% with Clean Policy ) <p> Speed matters and delay is costly : Our model found a mere five year delay ( 2010-2015 ) in accelerating technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggregate 1.2-1.4 million net unrealized jobs and 8-28 more gigatons of potential GHG emissions by 2050 . <p> Policy and innovation can enhance each other : Combining clean energy policies with technological breakthroughs increased the economic , security and pollution benefits for either innovation or policy alone . Take GHG emissions : the model showed that combining policy and innovation led to 59% GHG reductions by 2050 ( vs. 2005 levels ) , while maintaining economic growth . <p> This analysis assumed that breakthroughs in clean energy happened and that policies were put in place , and then tried to understand the impact . The data here allows us to imagine a world in which the U.S. captures the potential benefits of some clean energy technologies : economic growth , job generation and a reduction in harmful emissions . We have n't developed the roadmap , and getting there will take the right mix of policies , sustained investment in technological innovation by public and private institutions and mobilization of the private sectors entrepreneurial energies . We hope this analysis encourages further discussion and debate on these important issues .
