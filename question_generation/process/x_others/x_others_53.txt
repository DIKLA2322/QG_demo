We spent more than a year building a diverse team , researching , and learning from others in the field . With Google 's skills in information and technology in mind , we looked for areas where we could make the biggest potential impact by helping find scalable solutions . We are relative newcomers to these efforts and are enormously grateful for the guidance we 've received from experienced partners as we 've considered where we could best lean our shoulder against these global challenges side by side with local communities and the broader philanthropic community . <p> And now it is time to dive deep !

@@13269065 @1869065/ <h> Wednesday 8/31/2011 04:00:00 AM <p> In many ways , the arrival of Hurricane Irene last week drove home the importance of National Preparedness Month , an effort from the FEMA Ready campaign to encourage Americans to take steps to prepare for emergencies throughout the year . With people relying on the Internet worldwide , its not surprising that Google search data and a recently released American Red Cross survey show that people turn to online resources and tools for information and communication during major crises . First responders , who provide services in the aftermath of disasters , are also finding Internet and cloud-based tools and information usefulfor improving their understanding of a situation , collaborating with each other and communicating with the public . <p> Today , in preparation for Septembers National Preparedness Month , our Crisis Response team is introducing a new Google Crisis Preparedness website with information and educational tools on using technology to prepare for crises . On the site , you can see how individuals and organizations have used technology during crises in the past , including how two girls located their grandfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year and how Americorps tracked volunteers during the tornadoes in Joplin , Missouri in May of this year . There 's a section for responders with information on using Google tools in crises , such as collaborating efficiently using Google Docs , Spreadsheets and Sites , visualizing the disaster-related information with Google My Maps and Google Earth , and more . <p> Also , you can access a new public preparedness web resource launching today : Get Tech Ready , developed as a collaboration between FEMA , the American Red Cross , the Ad Council and Google Crisis Response . There , you 'll find tips on using technology to prepare for , adapt to and recover from disasters , for example : <p> Learn how to send updates via text and internet from your mobile phone in case voice communications are not available <p> Store your important documents in the cloud so they can be accessed from anywhere or in a secure and remote area such as a flash or jump drive that you can keep readily available <p> We encourage you to take a moment now to see how simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a crisis . Youll be more comfortable using these tools in the event of a disaster if you 've already tried them outand even integrated them into your daily life . <h> 8/31/2011 03:55:00 AM <p> People often share stories with us about the ways the Internet has helped them during natural disasters . Whether its accessing information about the event , communicating with loved ones during a crisis or finding out how to help respond in the aftermath , the web plays a valuable role . <p> We looked up some statistics from our search data for several natural disasters to get insights into this phenomenon . We see two consistent trends in search behavior and internet use in the affected areas : a substantial ( and often dominant ) proportion of searches are directly related to the crises ; and people continue to search and access information online even while traffic and search levels drop temporarily during and immediately following the crises . While in some cases internet access is restricted due to infrastructure failures , generally Internet Service Providers continue to provide connectivity and users take advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internet can be in times of crises , compared to other infrastructure . <p> We expect these trends will continue , and to a great extent this drives the ongoing work of the Google Crisis Response team to improve the information available on the ' net during crises . <p> Joplin Tornado , Joplin , MO , USA , May 2011The week of this years tornadoes in Joplin , Missouri , searches for terms related to help , safety and recovery were significantly up from normal levels . Disaster relief was 2054 percent greater than normal and FEMA , American Red Cross , and National Weather Service showed increases of 400-1000% . Despite the tragedy , in which 25 percent of the town was destroyed and 75 percent damaged , we still saw search traffic at 58 percent of normal levels the day of the tornado , and an immediate recovery toward normal Internet traffic occured within a day of the event . <p> Hurricane Katrina , New Orleans , LA , USA , August 2005During Hurricane Katrina , one of the largest U.S. disasters in recent memory , terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while search queries for resource providers like FEMA and the American Red Cross grew the fastest , according to our data . Even as 90% of the population was evacuated from New Orleans , we still saw search traffic at more than 50 percent of normal in Louisiana and 20% of normal in New Orleans , based on the previous five-day average . <p> The Internet has proven to be an essential resource during natural disasters internationally as well . <p> Japan Earthquake and Tsunami , Northern Coast , Japan , March , 2011During the Japan earthquake and tsunami , searches for earthquake information and impacts including terms like outage , tokyo electric power and rolling blackouts gew the fasted and also topped the list of most searched queries across Japan . In fact , even in the hardest hit areas , where mobile and landline communications were disrupted , Internet services were largely unaffected . During this time , people entered 620,000 records into Google Person Finder , a tool developed by the Google Crisis Response team to help people find missing friends and loved ones in the aftermath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , February 2010 Immediately following the earthquake , people searching online were actively looking for earthquake information ; earthquake and news source search terms became eight of the top 10 queries . Terremoto was the most searched term , and two online news sources , Terra and Emol , and the National Office for Emergencies onemi also appeared as top keywords . While there was no search traffic for 15 minutes after the earthquake , within one day searches had recovered to 25 percent of normal traffic , and search traffic returned to pre-earthquake levels within just four days . <p> Haiti Earthquake , Port-Au-Prince , Haiti , January 2010 The month of the Haiti earthquake , seismeor " earthquake " was the fastest-growing search term , and it continued its surface as a frequently searched term for almost two months after the earthquake . In the capital city of Port-Au-Prince , at the center of the earthquake , search traffic stopped momentarily , but did not completely disappear even when the three submarine Internet cables were cut as a result of the earthquake . As outlined by this U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were able to quickly reroute connections through a microwave relay wireless communication between Haiti and the Dominican Republic . This allowed traffic to return to rise within one day , and reach normal levels within a few months , despite ongoing damage to the city and countrys infrastructure . <p> Were excited about continuing our work to create and support products that make the Internet even more useful to people looking for information and communication during crises . <h> Saturday 8/27/2011 11:01:00 AM <p> Yesterday , we posted about our new Google Crisis Map , with the latest available geographic information on current disasters including Hurricane Irene . This morning , we put together a New York specific Crisis Map for Hurricane Irene , including Evacuation Zones , Shelter , and Storm Tracking . Sources include NYC Datamine , FEMA , American Red Cross and other organizations . <p> Each year we review our Google Flu Trends models and may update them , if an update would make them more accurate when compared with the official influenza data we benchmark against .

Though generally getting the trend correct , the original model underestimated the magnitude of ILI activity during the H1N1 . Why was this the case ? In short , search behavior changed during H1N1 . This was especially true for the categories " influenza complications " and " term for influenza . " This is not unexpected , since differing complications and the fact that H1N1 began spreading during the northern hemisphere summer rather than winter likely played a role . It is interesting to see how the categories and examples of specific queries changed , though . For some specific examples , read the paper . <p> Were soon headed into flu season for the half of the world in the Northern hemisphere , so let 's stay healthy ! <p> To help explore this information , we 've created the Google Crisis Map , a map viewer with the latest available geographic information .

Over 12.4 million people across Kenya , Ethiopia , Djibouti and Somalia are threatened with hunger and disease as they are unable to access basic survival means . UN agencies and other humanitarian organizations are rallying to support refugees on the move , particularly to the thousands fleeing Somalia . Valerie Amos , OCHA Emergency Relief Coordinator , has stated that " This will not be a short crisis . " The emergency is expected to persist at least three to four months , and the number of people needing humanitarian assistance could increase by as much as 25 percent . <p> Fresh and accurate maps are among the many critical factors in assessing such a state of crisis , as they provide vital information to facilitate emergency response and planning . Thanks to the efforts of our satellite imagery partner , GeoEye , we now have high resolution imagery of locations with the most pressing humanitarian needs . This has made Google Map Maker community mapping efforts even more effective , by allowing the creation of improved maps over refugee camps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Volunteers are mapping roads , hospitals , schools , community centers , and water resources , among other vital landmarks .

Google has provided a seed grant of US$250,000 , which will be allocated to 25 all-star proposals that incorporate technology as a means of addressing a specific social need , such as flood relief or disease prevention . The idea is not simply to fund the creation of software , but to fund ideas that use Information and Communication Technologies as a platform for delivery and as a means for empowerment . <p> In addition to offering funding , P@SHA has established an oversight committee , advisory board , and outreach gurus from the business IT community to guide the shortlisted proposals from inception to reality . The hope is to create a safe harbor for eager entrepreneurs to jump-start ideas without the fear of failure . P@SHA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerge from Pakistani youth . According to Jehan , one of Pakistans main strengths is that 60% of the population is below the age of 24 , something the country can leverage . Jehan believes a large number of these individuals are passionate about making a difference in the communities in which they live--and , to some extent , are already doing so . <p> Google Map Maker has already witnessed several such innovations in Pakistan , such as Sindh Flood Maps , FloodMAPS of Dr. Sohaib Khan , and http : //www.local.com.pk/ , which implement the Google Maps API to assist in disaster relief management . Proposals are being accepted through August , and are not limited by age , gender , caste or creed . P@SHA requires only that applicants be Pakistanis who are based in Pakistan and ready to share their innovations with the world . <p> Amongst others , we anxiously await any future mapping projects that may be in store following P@SHAs announcement of winners in the early fall , and encourage all our avid Pakistani mappers and brilliant innovators to submit their big idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrate with Ghana and the Carter Center the elimination of Guinea worm ( dracunculiasis ) from Ghana . Several years ago Google.org provided $1,450,000 in funding to the Carter Center to support the eradication of this debilitating , 3,000 year old disease from Ghana . Its now been 14 months since the last case of Guinea worm was reported there . <p> This is a fantastic accomplishment that took a lot of hard work by the Carter Center , the Ministry of Health and their partners . There is no drug to prevent the infection of Guinea worm disease . Thus , our funds supported health education , as village-based health workers were trained to educate people about the origins of the disease and how to prevent it . In addition , these health workers mobilized to treat water sources , advocate for the provision of clean water , and monitor and contain cases of Guinea worm . With our funds in 2008 , the Carter Center achieved an 85% reduction in cases--the largest year over year percentage reduction seen in the history of the program ! Ghana now enters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certification of its success . <p> Guinea worm is caused by a roundworm that lays its larvae in water . When people drink the infected water the larvae hatch inside them and can grow up to 3 feet in length before painfully emerging through their skin about a year later . There 's no way of knowing where the worm will emerge . Its not unusual for it to exit near the ankle or foot , which impairs the victims movement and ability to work . Its a slow and painful process to remove the worm without breaking it off in the patient . Often , affected individuals seek relief by submerging their sores in water , at which point the worm releases new larvae into the water and the cycle continues . <p> In 1986 , when the Carter Center began the campaign to eradicate Guinea worm , there were more than 3.5 million cases across 20 countries in Asia and Africa . Today , only 3 countries remain : South Sudan , Mali and Ethiopia . So far this year only 800 cases have been reported . <p> To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eradicated . The Carter Center is well on its way to making Guinea worm the second human disease to be wiped off the earth . <p> Update ( 8/10 ) : Text amended to reflect that Guinea worm would be the second human disease to be eradicated . The animal disease Rinderpest was announced as successfully eradicated in June of this year .
