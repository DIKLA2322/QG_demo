@@13268899 @1868899/ <h> Tuesday 11/30/2010 09:16:00 AM <p> Climate change is too often misunderstood to be simply an environmental issue , rather than a human issue . For our children and grandchildren , climate change is an issue of public health , economics , global security and social equity . This human side of climate change is explained in a new Google Earth tour narrated by former U.N . Secretary General Kofi Annan . Within these stories , you 'll find data and tools to explore this topic in more depth , and meet some of the people who are actively working on managing the risks of climate variability and change . We encourage you to take the tour to learn more about these human issues and the inspiring work of groups like the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa ( AGRA ) that are helping farmers cope with climate change . We hope this video will serve as a useful tool as educators help students around the world understand the complexity of this issue . <p> This is the latest in our series of climate change tours that were releasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Climate Change ( COP16 ) talks in Cancun , Mexico this week . <p> As part of the Google Earth for Educators Community , weve also created a special Climate Change Educators Resources page that teachers can use in their classrooms . Here , teachers can find the tools they need to create lesson plans about climate change , including all the individual Google Earth KML layers available for download . Teachers and students can overlay multiple data layers that help illustrate climate change , and discuss and analyze them as part of K-12 and higher education curriculum . Were also looking for lessons plans for any school grade that use this narrated tour or these Google Earth KML layers , so if you 're a teacher or instructor , please submit your lesson plan for review now .
