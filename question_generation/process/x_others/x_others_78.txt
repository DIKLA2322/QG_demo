At that time we announced a request for investment proposals ( RFP ) from teams working on technologies relevant to this goal . Today we are pleased to announce our first RechargeIT investments in two promising companies tackling the challenge of vehicle electrification.Aptera Motors of Carlsbad , California is building an ultra-high efficiency vehicle based on improved aerodynamics and composite materials . Aptera 's first prototype achieved over 230 miles per gallon during testing , and they are developing an all-electric as well as a plug-in hybrid vehicle based on this design . <p> ActaCell is an Austin-based company working to commercialize lithium-ion battery technology developed at the University of Texas at Austin . ActaCell 's technology offers the promise of improved battery cycle life and lower costs , while maintaining a focus on battery safety , all of which are important factors in the widespread adoption of plug-in vehicles . <p> Both of these innovative companies and their capable teams are working to develop technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : millions of plug-in vehicles on the road . <h> Tuesday 7/22/2008 12:24:00 PM <p> Last summer Google.org launched the RechargeIT program , an initiative to accelerate the commercialization of plug-in vehicles . As part of this project , we created the GFleet , a free car-sharing program for Google employees . The GFleet includes a handful of hybrid vehicles converted to plug-ins with a Hymotion conversion module . <p> Our plug-in hybrid electric vehicles ( PHEVs ) have been on the road for about a year now , and the RechargeIT team has been diligently collecting statistics on their performance . We noticed that employees primarily use our plug-ins for short trips close to our headquarters , so the data were n't truly representative of typical U.S. driving patterns . We were curious to see how the cars would perform under controlled conditions - and how they would stack up against other conventional automobiles typically found in U.S. households . With that , the RechargeIT Driving Experiment was born ! <p> In total , it took just over seven weeks to complete all the trips in all the vehicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great , with the Priuses getting more than 90 miles per gallon . The PHEVs not only greatly outperformed the average American fleet fuel economy of 19.8 MPG , they did significantly better than the standard hybrids 53% fuel economy improvement for the plug-in Ford Escape and 93% improvement for the plug-in Prius . <h> Thursday 7/10/2008 04:26:00 PM <p> HakiElimu , one of Google.orgs partners , recently released an important report about the quality of education in Tanzania to stimulate a national discussion about the challenges facing the education sector . Media coverage in Dar es Salaam indicates the report has already made an impression and is prompting the government to act . <p> For too long , success in the education sector has been defined by the number of schools and classrooms built and by the increase in student enrollment - measures that do n't necessarily register learning . But the conversation is now shifting : " quality " has become more front and center , forcing governments and development agencies to re-evaluate their policies . <p> Its hard to address the " quality " issue without knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HakiElimus report captures a " snapshot of the quality of education actually provided in schools by presenting the results of short tests administered to children in primary and secondary schools . " The sample pool is small , but the findings are interesting indicators of what may be happening in much of the country . Here are two of the findings that I found most powerful and alarming : <p> One of the tests was a short dictation in both Kiswahili , the national language , and English ( a total of 483 primary school students and 559 secondary school students were tested ) . While students scored higher on the Kiswahili dictations , HakiElimu found it " concerning that 25% of primary pupils Kiswahili dictations were rated " poor . " Pupils who took this test had completed six years of schooling in Kiswahili and yet one in four were unable to write a coherent paragraph as dictated in the national language . In the dictations , students in both primary and secondary schools made fundamental errors in punctuation , giving researchers the impression that these things are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case for letters . Similarly , many did not appear to have a sense of spacing between words , or between letters in the word and between sentences . Knowledge of punctuation was also limited " ( page 29 ) <p> The next point is equally alarming : Primary school students are taught in Kiswahili while in secondary schools the language of instruction is in English . As the report indicates , this is problematic . <p> " Overall , data show that while childrens Kiswahili language competencies are generally well developed , English language competencies are poorly developed in both primary and secondary school students . Students had difficulty in reading , writing and translating the language . This is particularly troublesome in case of secondary school students . On entering secondary schools , children not only have to relearn all the terms and concepts in a new language but also to take on a more difficult set of subjects . If the majority of the students in secondary schools are unable to read and understand the language in which they are taught , as our data show , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enhanced . ( page 33 ) <p> My colleagues and I often say " you ca n't fix what you cant see . " This report helps to highlight to communities , organizations and the government that while money might be spent on education , there are still significant gaps in learning outcomes . More information and data about these outcomes help create the metrics , so action can be taken to fix these gaps . We are proud of HakiElimu 's work and their commitment to ensuring that citizens and government know more about the quality of education in Tanzania . We believe that the information and the discussions it is sparking in Tanzania are important first steps toward improving the educational system . <h> Wednesday 7/09/2008 09:45:00 AM <p> I recently returned from a research trip across four East African countries . Every time I return from the region , I am energized by the dynamism of the young people I meet but overwhelmed by the challenges the region faces . The combination of high oil and food prices affects the United States economy , to be sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exponentially greater . People have to make hard decisions like taking their children out of school , rationing the little food they have , and in some cases not eating at all . High fuel prices also contribute to lower uses of fertilizer , resulting in lower agricultural yields . The cycle spirals in a way that hurts the poorest people the most . <p> And yet there is another story unfolding simultaneously in Eastern Africa . It is the story of Safaricom , the most successful telecom company on the continent . Safaricom started trading publicly on the Nairobi stock exchange in June and catalyzed the largest IPO on the continent ever . More than $800 million was raised from Kenyans from all walks of life , resulting in an over-subscription of stock of more than 400% . Mobile is growing faster in Africa than in any other part of the world . While levels of internet penetration are well below 5% for the continent , nearly 40% have access to mobile phones and Nairobi sends more text messages in a single day than New York ( a statistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago people were talking about land lines and how they would ever penetrate rural Africa . Infrastructure has long been a constraint on economic development and growth in Africa but nobody imagined that a new technology would completely leap-frog the traditional phone and fundamentally disrupt telephony in Africa . I ca n't help but think about rural energy in the same light . Today , countries like Uganda are still 90% unserved by electricity . Can you imagine not having power in 90% of any country and still trying to grow the economy ? Do we expect Africans to wait for grid electricity to incrementally reach people or are there disruptive innovations that can provide off-grid renewable energy to rural Africans in scaleable ways ? What would this look like given large geo-thermal and bio-diesel reserves in East Africa and can renewable energy sources provide opportunities for greener solutions in Africa ? <p> Interacting with dynamic and bright Africans under 30 ( who make up 70% or more of most African countries ) , I can not help but wonder what is on the horizon . People are innovating all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind , and solar power . Where people have electricity , there is a massive difference in economic activity , public services , productivity , and hope about the future . Energy is truly a platform that affects nearly every aspect of rural life . Today , Africa is mostly unserved by power grids but given innovation possibilities , are there not scalable ways to introduce renewable energy to millions of people who are completely unplugged from the global economy today ? <p> We 're proud to support HealthMap as they continue to hone their methodology and expand their coverage , including the addition of Hindi , Portuguese , and Arabic language information sources to their current suite of Chinese , Spanish , Russian , French and English . Way to go HealthMap ... keep up the good work !
