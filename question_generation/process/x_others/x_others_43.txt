Today , in 13 countries , well begin displaying some combination of special search results for searches around poison control , suicide and common emergency numbers that point to emergency information . <p> This effort started last year when I received an email from a mother in the U.S. who had trouble finding the phone number for the poison control hotline after her daughter accidentally ingested something potentially poisonous ( fortunately , her daughter was fine ) . As a result , people in the U.S. performing various searches including " poison control " began to see a special result displaying the national phone number for the American Association of Poison Control Centers last fall . <p> Example of the poison control result in Spain <p> Soon after we added poison control information to search results , we heard from Googlers whose lives had been affected by suicide and who thought that suicide prevention could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we began prominently displaying the number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at the top of the results page for certain search queries in the U.S. Since then , our friends at the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline have reported a 9 percent increase in legitimate calls to its hotline . <p> Example of the suicide prevention result in the UK <p> So , following positive feedback from consumers and our hotline partners , we decided to expand the poison control and suicide prevention special search results beyond the U.S. Each of these 13 countries will see one or more of these results : Australia , Belgium , France , Germany , Hungary , Italy , Netherlands , New Zealand , Norway , Spain , Sweden , Switzerland and the United Kingdom . We looked for hotlines that are available nationally and 24/7 and we hope to add additional countries in the future . <p> We 're also introducing a new special search result for common emergencies , such as fire , medical and police emergencies .

Trees do occupy a powerful place in our emotions , but the most powerful argument to protect our worlds trees is not based on sentiment . There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for survival . Trees are our watersheds , protectors of the natural environment , and sources of food . Remove the trees from the equation and the community feels the impact . <p> I came to this realization in the 1970s in Kenya . I was talking to women in my community about their problems : hunger , access to water , poverty , wood fuel . I saw a link between their needs and the condition of the land and thought , " Why not plant trees to address these issues ? " Trees hold the soil to the ground so that we can grow food in it , they protect watersheds and facilitate harvesting of rain water , fruits trees supplement food and trees give us domestic energy and wood with which to build our shelters . So while still working at the University of Nairobi , I established a tree nursery in my backyard , planted seven trees at a public park and founded the Green Belt Movement . The organization works to empower communities , to build their capacity to restore Africa 's forests and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of environmental degradation cause . As a result of this idea , more than 40 million trees have been planted to restore the environment and improve the lives of the people who are linked to the land . <p> When we were offered a unique opportunity to partner with the Google Earth Outreach team on a project using new Google Earth technology to visualize trees in 3D , we were thrilled . For accuracy and integrity we worked very closely with Google , advising them on the modeling of unique African trees like the broad-leaved Croton , the Nile tulip tree and the East African Cordia . These tree models illustrate the biodiversity in our tree planting sites , especially in the forests , and how we carefully select trees that are indigenous and sustainable to the natural surroundings . <p> Broad-leaved Croton , the Nile tulip tree and the East African Cordia ( from left to right ) <p> We then used data from real planting locations to " plant " the tree models in Google Earth and create 3D visualizations .

It helps people come together to address common problems and work collectively towards community improvement and sustainability . I hope that seeing our beautiful tree planting sites in 3D on Google Earth will be a source of inspiration for people to engage , plant trees and organize planting activities in their own communities . Taking charge of our lives and the environment around us can help ensure a lasting legacy and healthy future for our children .

Floods , hurricanes , heatwaves , and droughts nearly always bring with them various threats to public health including the emergence and spread of infectious diseases . However , these threats now loom even larger with the expected rise in the frequency and intensity of extreme events as a result of the Earths changing climate . <p> In times of disaster our vulnerabilities are revealed . While the recent extreme events can not be directly attributed to climate change , they are omens of what lie ahead and their devastating impacts raise serious questions about societys vulnerability to , and its ability to cope with continued climate change . <p> The good news is that environmental and health scientists are beginning to work together to get us ahead of the curve and prepare for the changes underway by designing new analytical tools , providing access to real-time data , and developing forecasts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephen Connor at the International Research Institute for Climate and Society ( IRI ) have developed a Summer Institute 2008 on Climate Information for Public Health .

The population has swelled to 100,000 from approximately 70,000 largely because of refugees fleeing the post-election violence in other parts of Kenya . Local authorities expect to see that population double over the next ten years . Providing public services , especially water and sanitation , to this growing population is an enormous challenge . <p> In 2000 , the international community made a commitment to the UN Millennium Development Goals to help communities access basic public services , like health , education , water and sanitation . One the key milestones of Goal 7 is to " halve the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015 . " As of 2004 , the MDG Monitor shows the nations bordering Lake Victoria- Uganda , Tanzania and Kenya only 60% of their populations have access to improved drinking water sources . <p> While great progress is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60% of their population has adequate service , despite what the official statistics say . New water pipes have been donated to the local water provider . This has doubled the capacity , but it only reaches half of Kisii 's estimated population ( 50,000 ) . Water kiosks stand proudly along the main road . And yet , the taps run dry . The connections to the main line are not even functional . Young women still trudge the kilometers to the river , at risk to their own security , to collect water . Bright blue toilet stalls line the periphery of a girls school . While the school has seen an increase in attendance since the installation of these toilets , they continue to be plagued by their inability to deal with the sanitation requirements of their students . As we depart , the headmistress of the school pleads with us to help with the sanitation problem . <p> Some more recent data gathered from towns surrounding Lake Victoria in Uganda , Tanzania and Kenya , tell us a very different story than information from the MDG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us on the ground : while basic infrastructure ( water pipes , points , toilets ) may exist , those facilities are rarely functional , affordable or accessible , indicating to us that access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation services is substantially lower than many think . Presented with this information at a recent UN-Habitat meeting in Nairobi , international donors and development agencies were astonished . They asked , " how come we did n't know about this earlier ? " <p> And yet , unsurprisingly , the people of Kisii have long known that they do n't have appropriate water and sanitation services . They may not have even heard of the MDG 's . They are likely unaware of the conversations that transpire amongst donors and development agencies and help shape where resources are allocated . They are having their own conversations about what they need . But who can they tell ? Who hears their voices ? <p> Our challenge going forward is to help amplify these voices and contribute to efforts to inform these local discussions . <h> 6/13/2008 07:35:00 AM <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Google.org-Brookings Institution conference was punctuated by a panel moderated by Tom Friedman . The lively discussion covered topics including policy leadership , innovative business models , the potential for plug-ins to become greener over time , and the security and stability of the grid . Two important themes emerged the importance of plug-ins and clean energy for U. S. economic competitiveness and the policy and leadership needed to make this industry transformation a reality.Jon Wellinghoff , Commissioner of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ( FERC ) , surprised many in the audience by describing the 40 million electric vehicles on the road today in China ( many of which are scooters ) and emphatically argued that the grid is ready for plug-ins today . John Podesta , President of the Center for American Progress , credited Germanys feed-in tariff with creating a vibrant solar industry in Germany and causing the U. S. market share of the global solar industry to decline from 45% to 10% . Assistant Secretary of Energy Andy Karsnerannounced a $30 million Department of Energy investment in plug-in vehicle technology . Sue Tierney talked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Washington at the state level and within the business community . Finally , Congressman Jay Inslee inspired the crowd by suggesting that we need visionary leadership on plug-in vehicles and renewable energy , likening the climate crisis to the challenge put forth by John F.

Electrifying transportation impacts our economy , national security , and environment , and conference sessions overflowed with interested attendees . The lively afternoon session highlighted the broad coalition supporting plug-ins and demonstrated that the technology we need to electrify transportation is here today . <p> Jim Woolsey passionately argued that our dependence on oil is a national security emergency and that countries like Japan and Brazil have demonstrated the potential to overhaul an automotive fleet in a short period of time . Shai Agassi described Project Better Place and their plans to rapidly deploy electric vehicles in Israel . <p> Several speakers , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NRDC study on the impact of significant deployment of plug-in hybrids , including the finding that our current electric grid could power 73% of our vehicles if we charged them at night . Peter Darbee from PG&amp;E talked about how plug-in vehicles could work with smart electricity meters to increase the efficiency of the grid . <h> Tuesday 6/10/2008 08:17:00 PM <p> Posted by Michael Terrell , Program Manager , Google.org <p> A new survey commissioned by Google.org shows that three out of four voters support an active government role in promoting plug-in electric cars and trucks . The poll of more than 700 likely voters covered topics ranging from knowledge about plug-ins to opinions on how the government should promote them . <p> Plug-in electric vehicles run like regular hybrid cars , except they have larger batteries , recharge from a standard wall outlet , and can go more miles with less gas . Some plug-ins are purely electric and do n't  need gasoline at all . Given today 's record-high gas prices and concerns about energy security , plug-ins represent a promising solution for reducing oil dependence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Poll data showed a majority of voters said they would be more likely to vote for a candidate who supports federal efforts to bring plug-ins to the market , and more than 60 percent of voters are willing to spend more money to own a plug-in vehicle . <p> Over the next two days , Google.org and the Brookings Institution are hosting a conference in Washington , DC , " Plug-in Electric Vehicles 2008 : What Role for Washington ? " The conference will bring together Members of Congress , auto and utility executives , technologists , and plug-in advocates to spotlight plug-ins , examine their potential , and explore different federal policies to promote them .
