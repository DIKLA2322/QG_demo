The company is expected to provide capital to small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) and by doing so , help create jobs . <p> In many developing countries , large businesses use formal , bank-based credit and capital markets for their financing needs , while households and micro-entrepreneurs have access to micro-loans . SMEs are often stuck in the middle without reliable access to either , and they are largely absent from the formal economies of many of these countries . <p> The investment company is designed to help address this " missing middle . " Most existing SME funds make investments in the $3-$5 million range in India , which leaves out a significant portion of the market . This new company , in contrast , will target equity opportunities between $500,000 and $3.5 million . The company is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pyramid Lab at the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad in order to leverage the school 's SME experience . <p> During a recent trip to India , our Google.org SME team visited a number of businesses and financial organizations and saw firsthand that there is a " missing middle " . We hope this investment company will help start to fill it in . <p> For more detail on our initiative to fuel the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises , watch this : <p> Update:We 'd like to alert you to two job postings envisioned for the investment advisory company described below .
