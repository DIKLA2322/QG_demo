@@13268950 @1868950/ <h> Tuesday 8/19/2008 07:26:00 AM <p> Today , as part of our Renewable Energy Cheaper than Coal initiative , Google.org announced more than $10 million in investments and grants in Enhanced Geothermal Systems ( EGS ) technology . EGS expands the potential of traditional geothermal energy by orders of magnitude . The traditional geothermal approach relies on finding naturally occurring pockets of steam or hot water . The EGS process , by comparison , replicates these conditions by fracturing hot rock , circulating water through the system , and using the resulting steam to produce electricity in a conventional turbine . <p> EGS has the potential to provide clean renewable electricity 24/7 , at a cost cheaper than coal . The ability to produce electricity from geothermal energy has been thought exclusive to locations such as California and Iceland . However EGS could allow us to harness the heat within the earth almost anywhere . To see see the massive size of the US geothermal resource accessible by EGS , check out our Google Earth layer . For more on EGS , watch this video , featuring Dr. Steve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dr. Jefferson Tester , professor of Chemical Engineering at MIT and lead author of a major recent study on EGS : <p> Working with Geodynamics , one of the world 's leading EGS development companies , we modeled Geodynamics ' first 50 MW system at the Cooper Basin in SketchUp , Google 's 3D modeling technology . To see how EGS works , check out the animation of the SketchUp model or download it . <p> EGS is heating up around the world . Australia , Germany , and the European Union are currently leading the technology and commercialization race . All 50 U.S. states , Europe , Russia , China , and India all have substantial thermal resources accessible by EGS . <p> While the US debates drilling in the ocean for oil , we are focused on drilling for renewable energy - and lots of it - right beneath our feet . A recent report by MIT on EGS estimated just 2% of the heat 3 - 10 km below below the continental United States is more than 2,500 times the country 's total annual energy use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help catch up to other nations , including expanded R&amp;D funding , a national renewable portfolio standard , and reliable tax incentives . For more on our geothermal policy agenda , read this brief . <h> Friday 8/01/2008 11:17:00 AM <p> In the 1970s and 1980s , America 's push for energy conservation meant " doing less with less " - lowering the thermostat , turning off lights , donning a sweater , and leaving the car in the garage . Following up his testimony from earlier this month , Dan Reicher , Google.org 's Director of Climate Change and Energy Initiatives , visited Capitol Hill again this week to discuss a new 21st Century approach - harnessing technology to achieve greater energy efficiency and " do more with less . " <p> The hearing , which also featured Ian Bowles , Massachusetts ' Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs , focused on ways in which consumers , businesses , and government can work together to achieve greater energy efficiency . Studies have shown that efficiency opportunities can cut global energy demand to less than half of what is projected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new vision for how America generates , transmits , and uses electricity . He noted that the increasing interplay between energy hardware and information software , along with the rise of the Internet and the connectivity it brings , adds to the potential to make and use energy more productively . From smart meters and smart appliances to smart homes and a smart grid , we are poised to significantly advance our ability to monitor and manage energy . <p> Dan highlighted Google.org 's RechargeIT initiative and discussed the efficiency advantages of plug-in vehicles . He emphasized how the government could help get more plug-ins on the road by providing financial incentives , investing in our national electricity infrastructure , funding R&amp;D , and modernizing our regulatory system to permit real-time pricing of power . <p> Dan 's other proposals include implementing an Energy Efficiency Resource Standard , which would set efficiency resource targets for electricity and gas suppliers . He also called for increased federal support for weatherizing energy inefficient homes in low-income communities , and for improved financial incentives to encourage private-sector investment in promising clean energy technologies .
