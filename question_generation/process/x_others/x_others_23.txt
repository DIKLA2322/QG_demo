We want students to not just be consumers of technology , but also creators of it ; to enrich not only their own lives , but those of their communities . That 's the motivation behind the Google RISE ( Roots in Science and Engineering ) Awards . <p> Given once a year , Google RISE Awards are designed to promote and support education initiatives to increase engagement in science and technology , especially computer science . Google grants awards of $15,000 - $50,000 USD to non-for-profit organizations around the world working to expand access to these fields for K-12/Pre-University students , specifically girls and underrepresented groups . <p> In 2013 , 30 organizations received RISE grantswith projects ranging from robotics contests in Germany to programming challenge days for girls in New Zealand . In June , we brought all of our partners together for a Global Summit . It was an inspiring meeting , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expand their reach . <p> For example , our RISE partners in Nigeria , WAAW Foundation and W-TEC , have teamed up to organize a one-week residential Advanced STEM Camp . The program launched this week and will provide 27 public school girls exposure to robotics . Over in Argentina , an organization already connecting Belgium to Argentina is is now collaborating with another on programming workshops for students and teachers . And organizations in Liberia and India are sharing resources to overcome common challenges in access to technology for girls . <p> Were looking for more organizations to partner with in 2014 . Submit your application by September 30 , 2013 . You can submit your application in English , French , Japanese , Russian or Spanish ; all eligible countries are listed on our website . Show us what you can do to get students excited about STEM and CS !
