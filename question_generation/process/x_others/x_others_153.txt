@@13269055 @1869055/ <h> Wednesday 9/29/2010 04:30:00 PM <p> This past weekend at the 2010 World Expo , UN Institute for Training and Research ( UNITAR ) and Google gave a joint presentation and informational session about their recent work together in global humanitarian mapping . <p> Illustrating his remarks with information about the Pakistan 2010 flood relief efforts , UNITAR Geospatial Analyst Josh Lyons explained how Google Map Maker helps his organization quickly and accurately produce geospatial products and emergency response maps . By leveraging the high quality , up-to-date information provided by users in Google Map Maker , UNITAR is able to produce and distribute helpful composite map products using tools such as UNITARS Operational Satellite Applications Programme ( UNOSAT ) . These products played a key role in facilitating modern humanitarian relief for the recent disaster in Pakistan . <p> Dr. Carlos Lopes , United Nations Assistant Secretary-General and Executive Director of UNITAR , expressed his excitement both to work with Google and that UNITAR/UNOSAT resources that had previously been spent on mapping data collection could now be invested directly into analysis . He remarked that users and beneficiaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international NGOs and national entities from government and civil societies , and of course , the people directly affected by disasters and other crises . <p> We hope that the interest and increased awareness that the Shanghai World Expo event generated about Google Map Maker helps to build an even stronger user community . Its the online mapping contributions of volunteers across the globe that enable Map Maker to be a valuable tool for humanitarian activities like this as well as a source of quality maps in the developing world . Let 's continue mapping the world together ! <h> Tuesday 9/28/2010 03:42:00 PM <p> Last years flu season began with significant fanfare and concern . The H1N1 virus posed a new threat to public health and sent governments around the world scrambling to protect peoples well-being . We do n't  yet know the severity of this flu season , but have learned in the past that many people come to Google to search for information about the flu . <p> In time for the upcoming flu season , Google is again collaborating with the U.S. Department for Health and Human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Lung Association to release a feature which allows people to more easily find nearby locations for getting the flu vaccine . By searching for terms like flu or flu shot , information will appear at the top of your search results , including tips from flu.gov as well as the flu vaccine finder box with an expanding map that displays locations where you can receive vaccine . <p> This years flu vaccine protects against the three viruses that research suggests will be most common , including the H1N1 virus , so officials do not expect the need for multiple vaccines . <p> We continue to hope for a relatively uneventful flu season , but encourage you to prepare appropriately . <p> Update on 9/30 : Kathleen Sebelius , Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services , just announced that the flu vaccine finder is now embedded on flu.gov , along with instructions for how others can embed it on their site . <h> Friday 9/24/2010 08:38:00 AM <p> Two years ago today , we began Project 10100 by asking you to share your ideas for changing the world by helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surpassed even our most optimistic expectations . People from more than 170 countries submitted more than 150,000 ideas . We selected 16 big ideas and asked the public to vote for their favorites . The five ideas that received the most votes are the winners of Project 10100 . Over the past 12 months , we 've reviewed concrete proposals to tackle these ideas , and today were pleased to give a total of $10 million to five inspiring organizations working on solutions to each of these global challenges : <p> Idea : Make educational content available online for freeProject funded : The Khan Academy is a non-profit educational organization that provides high-quality , free education to anyone , anywhere via an online library of more than 1,600 teaching videos . We are providing $2 million to support the creation of more courses and to enable the Khan Academy to translate their core library into the worlds most widely spoken languages . <p> Idea : Enhance science and engineering educationProject funded : FIRST is a non-profit organization that promotes science and math education around the world through team competition . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology leaders by giving them real world experience working with professional engineers and scientists . We are providing $3 million to develop and jump start new student-driven robotics team fundraising programs that will empower more student teams to participate in FIRST . <p> Idea : Make government more transparentProject funded : Public.Resource.Org is a non-profit organization focused on enabling online access to public government documents in the United States . We are providing $2 million to Public.Resource.Org to support the Law.Gov initiative , which aims to make all primary legal materials in the United States available to all . <p> Idea : Drive innovation in public transportProject funded : Shweeb is a concept for short to medium distance , urban personal transport , using human-powered vehicles on a monorail . We are providing $1 million to fund research and development to test Shweebs technology for an urban setting . <p> Idea : Provide quality education to African studentsProject funded : The African Institute for Mathematical Sciences ( AIMS ) is a center for math and science education and research in Cape Town , South Africa . AIMS primary focus is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build skills and knowledge prior to Masters and PhD study . We are providing $2 million to fund the opening of additional AIMS centers to promote graduate level math and science study in Africa . <p> here 's a short video celebrating the inspiring work of these organizations : <p> Weve learned that it takes quite a bit of effort and time to move from 150,000 ideas to five funded projects , but are excited about the potential of the ideas and projects you helped us choose . Were happy to conclude Project 10100 with todays announcement of five winning ideas and encourage you to follow the progress of these projects on the organizations websites . <h> Tuesday 9/21/2010 08:27:00 AM <p> At the opening ceremony of the Clinton Global Initiative ( CGI ) this morning , President Clinton discussed the urgent need to help the people of Pakistan recover from widespread floods which have affected more people than the 2004 South Asia tsunami , the 2005 South Asia earthquake , and the Haiti earthquake combined . The floods have put one-fifth of the land underwater , impacting more than 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting 3.5 million children at risk of waterborne diseases , and wiping out livestock and crops . <p> Amazing work is already being done by these organizations . SIUT , for example , has already established seven medical relief camps and three field hospitals in different parts of the country . Their doctors and paramedics have treated more than 100,000 people , many of whom are suffering from gastroenteritis , malaria and skin diseases . <p> In remarks during the opening plenary today , Eric Schmidt noted the importance of bringing 21st century technology solutions to disaster relief work . In collaboration with numerous NGOs , for example , Google developed Person Finder , an application that allows individuals to check on the status of friends and loved ones affected by a disaster , a few days after the Haiti earthquake . We developed Resource Finder , an experimental tool that aggregates information on health facilities to help first responders , and shared our MapMaker data with the U.N . Weve published sites linked from our homepage to provide updated maps and imagery , videos , news and ways to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chile , China , Pakistan and the Gulf oil spill . <p> Were excited to be at CGI this week to learn about innovative ways to use technology to assist with health , development and disaster response . We encourage non-profits to visit our newly updated Google for NonProfits site to learn how Googles free tools can help expand the impact of each organization . <h> Friday 9/10/2010 10:56:00 AM <p> Like many friends in the Bay Area and across the country , I 've been stunned by the images of raging fires in San Bruno . Nearly 40 structures have been destroyed and 120 damaged , with several fatalities and multiple injuries after the explosion of a gas line . More than 100 people have been evacuated to nearby shelters . <p> This disaster strikes close to home ; our YouTube offices are about two miles away from the main gas explosion . Were thankful that no Google employee was hurt , but remain concerned for the well-being of our neighbors in the area . <p> We are donating an initial amount of $50,000 to the American Red Cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directing Googlers to the local blood drives today and will be hosting blood drives in our San Bruno , Mountain View and San Francisco offices early next week . <p> Weve created this map to show the location of the explosion and highlight nearby shelters and resources . The map is open for collaboration and welcomes additional useful information . We encourage you to embed it in your website or blog . We are also exploring the possibility of obtaining updated imagery of the area to help responders visualize the scope of the disaster . <p> Our hearts go out to our neighbors who have been affected by the explosion . We thank the firefighters and first responders who have been working tirelessly to contain the fires and help the residents of San Bruno . You can donate to help here . <h> Thursday 9/09/2010 06:06:00 PM <p> Official data on the number of people still lacking access to adequate water and sanitation services prove that the current situation is simply unacceptable : 884 million people lack adequate access to clean water and 2.6 billion lack access to proper sanitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Program . Disease spreads rapidly with over one billion people forced to defecate outside due to a lack of sanitation and indoor plumbing ; in fact , unsafe water and sanitation is the most important environmental cause of ill-health , with millions dying every year as a result of poor water , sanitation and hygiene conditions . Young children in particular tend to suffer from water-borne diseases such as diarrhoea . <p> Success in water supply and sanitation interventions is commonly measured in terms of the number of wells dug , public water points connected or public toilets constructed . This is what the official data - available at national scale only - reflect . The assumption is that every water point and every toilet will provide adequate and sustainable services to a fixed number of people . Too often , though , wells run dry , hand pumps break , toilets go " out-of-service , " or the quality of the water provided is not safe . <p> As a result the official data seriously underestimate the water and sanitation crisis . A realistic assessment requires continuous monitoring at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The H2.0group of partners set out to demonstrate that community level monitoring of operational water and sanitation services is feasible at national scales . Google.org is one of the H2.0 partners . We have co-funded the effort and provided technical support . Yesterday the group launched the H2.0 platform at a World Water Week event in Stockholm . Over the past several years , the partners have collected detailed water and sanitation service data and developed a data management and mapping platform . This platform will enable users open access to analyse , visualise and interact with the data . We want to support government and development partners prioritize water investments and help NGOs and service providers assess their performance in a transparent manner . <p> Three components of the platform show Google tools in action . <p> The data show that the number of people with access to safe and affordable water is significantly lower than official estimates have previously shown : <p> For Kenya , the initial analysis of data collected by the Water Services Trust Fund shows , according to Han Seur of GTZ , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a total population over 4.5 million less than 25% have access to safe and affordable water . " <p> For TanzaniaWaterAid and partners mapped over 25 thousand rural public water points in 2006 . Vincent Casey of WaterAid summarized their report as : " Water point data mapped by WaterAid Tanzania has demonstrated that nearly half ( 46% ) of rural water points are not functional . A quarter of all new water points are no longer working just two years after installation . " <p> For Zanzibar , according to Graham Alabaster of UN-Habitat : " Counting only those who are paying less 10% of their income for water as having affordable access , the water access rate had to be revised from 90% down to 22% . " <p> Unfortunately this information implies that the water and sanitation crisis is affecting two to three times more people in the areas surveyed than the official data suggest . <p> Better data on water services can help consumers hold their water service provider accountable . H2.0 partner ITC developed the Human Sensor Web , a system that allows Zanzibar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messages on water quality and availability . <p> To understand the issue and invest in solutions that work , we need to stop measuring success as construction of taps and toilets , and start measuring success by monitoring the number of people with sustainable access to safe and affordable water and sanitation services .
