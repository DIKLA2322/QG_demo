He closes his eyes and visualizes his next painting , whether that be a group of Maasai women collecting water from a well , or villagers dancing before a brilliant Tanzanian sunset . For years , Gregory has been capturing the rich heritage of the Tanzanian Maasai with painstaking dedication . His delicate strokes against the canvas radiate a warmth and brightness unrivaled by his peers - one that had once never reached far beyond that maze of streets in Dar es Salaam . <p> It was n't until the summer of 2007 that I first had the privilege of meeting Gregory Mchopa and witnessing his work . I had traveled to Tanzania as part of an outreach trip for google.org , during which we met with local businesses in Dar es Salaam and gave presentations with the goal to spark local economic growth . We spoke before local entrepreneurs , established businessmen , and government politicians ; but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maze of streets that we truly recognized the potential for sparking local enterprise . After watching Gregory paint a brilliant work of three Maasai women carrying water over their heads to the backdrop of a sweeping red sky , he sat down to explain the difficulties of being an artist in Tanzania : a limited market , a lack of connectivity , and an absence of distribution channels . <p> Gregory suffered not for lack of passion or talent , but from the lack of technologies and services that could broadcast his work to a far wider audience . After returning to the States , I worked with BRUTE LABS ( a non-profit I founded with several other Googlers ) to build a simple website , www.mchopa.com , that would bring Gregory 's work before a global audience . Using several Google tools that are free and easy to use - App Engine , Checkout , Spreadsheets , Gmail - we developed a website and interface for Gregory that serves as an open source model for other artists in the developing world seeking to showcase and sell their work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has sold 47 paintings and kept all of the profits . Perhaps more significantly , Gregory 's web presence has connected him with gallery representatives and individual collectors in the US , Canada , and the UK , many of whom have requested custom works for display . The culture of the Maasai has now spread to people around the world . <p> Down a remote alleyway in Dar es Salaam , Gregory Mchopa continues to faithfully wield his paint brush , capturing the heritage of his country and people . But through Google 's online suite of tools , he now wields the power to broadcast his work far beyond that maze of streets to a global audience of buyers , suppliers , and admirers . The only question left for us now : who 's the next Gregory Mchopa ? <p> We just completed a substantial 20-year green Power Purchase Agreement that allows us to take responsibility for our footprint and foster true growth in the renewable energy sector . On July 30 we will begin purchasing the clean energy from 114 megawatts of wind generation at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a predetermined rate for 20 years . Incorporating such a large amount of wind power into our portfolio is tricky ( read more about how the deal is structured ) , but this power is enough to supply several data centers . <p> The wind farm , which began operation in December 2009 , consists of 100 GE 1.5MW XLE turbines . <p> By contracting to purchase so much energy for so long , were giving the developer of the wind farm financial certainty to build additional clean energy projects . The inability of renewable energy developers to obtain financing has been a significant inhibitor to the expansion of renewable energy . Weve been excited about this deal because taking 114 megawatts of wind power off the market for so long means producers have the incentive and means to build more renewable energy capacity for other customers . <p> We depend upon large quantities of electricity to power Google services and want to make large actions to support renewable energy .

For many years I turned to Steve for advice on climate science and insights into the political process .

With over 1.4 million customers , Yello is among Germany 's ten largest electricity companies and the very first company to offer commercial smart meters nationwide in Germany . <p> When Yello Executive Director Martin Vesper gave us a demo of the Sparz+hler meter a few months ago , it felt like fate -- Yello 's solution for making energy information easy-to-access and easy-to-act-upon aligns perfectly with our vision for Google PowerMeter . The Sparz+hler meter 's broadband connectivity makes it possible for Google PowerMeter users to see 15 minute interval data nearly in real time . ( Its design is also pretty sleek , we think . ) <p> Google PowerMeter now has nine utility partners around the world , large and small -- and each partner shares our goal of giving customers easy access to their own home energy usage information . <p> We hear from utilities around the world that are interested in enabling their customers to use Google @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working with those utilities that can collect a minimum of hourly data ( that 's 24 reads a day ) and deliver it to Google within one day .

We 're announcing an exciting partnership between MTN Uganda , the Grameen Foundation and Google , along with the launch of Google SMS in Uganda . This launch makes available the first suite of applications resulting from an endeavor initiated by Grameen Foundation called " AppLab " ( Application Laboratory ) which began over a year ago . AppLab is designed to develop mobile applications that serve the needs of poor and other vulnerable individuals and communities , most of whom have limited access to information and communications technology . <p> At Google we seek to serve a broad base of people not only those who can afford to access the Internet from the convenience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's important to reach users wherever they are , with the information they need , in areas with the greatest information poverty . Hence the launch of Google SMS , a bundle of mobile services for users to access content on a range of topics . This not only includes traditional services such as sports scores and local news , but for the first time , also includes services such as health and agriculture tips . <p> We are also releasing Google Trader , an SMS-based " marketplace " application that helps buyers and sellers find each other , enabling greater access to markets and trade , especially for those who are most excluded today . With these services , we hope to help alleviate some of the information and access to markets barriers for the poor , especially those in rural areas . So when farmers in Iganga want to sell their maize , they can list it on Google Trader and a miller in another trading center can find and contact them to buy their goods ( see picture below ) . If a pregnant woman has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question to 6001 and get a response right away . Now people in any part of Uganda can easily find the information that is most critical to them . <p> Miller in trading center calling women 's farming group in Iganga to obtain maize . <p> These activities also represent an important milestone : our first major initiative in Uganda , one of the newest locations where Google is setting up operations . Earlier this year , I joined the Google Africa team to lead our efforts in Uganda , where we want to offer valuable services that address real needs . As East African fiber optic cables begin to connect Uganda to the global Internet community , it is vital that the foundation for a thriving Internet economy also be established . Many impressive organizations are focused on this goal , and we hope to enhance these efforts . <p> Finally , this launch represents the team efforts of many local partners , communities and individuals , each of whom played a role in bringing this vision to life . The Village Phone Operators represent our very first set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the participation of farmers in more distant villages was fundamental in creating the highly local content created by them , for them , through our local partner BROSDI ( Busoga Rural Open Source and Development Initiative ) , in collaboration with AppLab . While developing the health tips service , students , health workers , doctors and school nurses stepped forward as leaders in their respective areas and turned this humble mission into a reality . Our partners , Straight Talk Foundation and Marie Stopes International , not only created the content with AppLab based on the input of these many constituents , but forged deep and strong links with the communities where these services are in greatest demand . <p> When we return to these villages with a product that will be developed through their insights , we want to understand if the service truly is having an impact . To this end , we are conducting a social impact assessment with Innovations for Poverty Action , with support from Google.org , to build from the knowledge of what users need most , to understand what works best . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizations already doing impressive work to reach a broader audience and those with the greatest need , in new and innovative ways , through the mobile phone . This is the first of many exciting collaborative efforts we will be working on to support access to information in Uganda and more broadly , across Africa . So to everyone who participated in this effort , we say Webale Nyo ! <h> 6/22/2009 08:19:00 AM <p> While many organizations are doing great work to enable community service locally , it 's not simple to search across opportunities from a variety of places to find what 's right for you . We have some experience finding relevant information from among many scattered sources , and when we learned that President Obama and the First Lady were making community service a top priority even before taking office , we thought we could help make a difference . <p> With our mission in mind , a group of " 20% " engineers , designers , and program managers from Google and other tech companies began work on All for Good , a new service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and share those events with your friends . <p> All for Good provides a single search interface for volunteer activities across many major volunteering sites and organizations like United Way , VolunteerMatch , HandsOn Network and Reach Out and Read . By building on top of the amazing efforts of existing volunteer organizations like these , we hope to amplify their efforts . <p> And in the spirit of open data , All for Good has a data API that anyone can use to search the same data displayed on the All for Good site . All for Good was developed entirely using App Engine and Google Base , with the full code repository hosted on Google Code Hosting . We 'll be inviting developers to contribute to the open source application soon , so stay tuned . <p> Just as releasing the Maps API led to an surge of independent and creative uses of geographic information , we 've built All for Good as a platform to encourage innovation in volunteerism , as much as an end product in itself . We hope software developers will use the API @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even better than the All for Good site ! <p> And if you want to volunteer your video-creating skills to make a difference , check out YouTube Video Volunteers , a new platform designed to make connections between non-profits with video needs and skilled video makers who can help broadcast their causes through video . <p> All for Good is a new kind of collaboration between the private , public , and nonprofits sectors to build free and open technology to empower citizens . Similar to the Open Social Foundation , we helped create a new organization called Our Good Works to make sure that the API , the platform , and social innovation that they inspire are supported for the long term . The leadership includes Reid Hoffman , Chris DiBona , Arianna Huffington and Craig Newmark on the board , and the organization aims to build support volunteerism services like All for Good . <p> Today the First Lady is in San Francisco calling on Americans to improve our communities by rolling up our sleeves and putting our time and talent towards doing good .

Google Flu Trends can not be used to identify individual users . The patterns we observe are only meaningful across large populations of Google searchers . <p> For those Kiwis and Aussies out there , avoid becoming part of our statistics and get a flu shot !

Considering many ideas , we talked about what it will take to finally eradicate polio in the developing world , and the role that philanthropy can play . Many of our parents remember what it was like to have polio in this country , and a few people in the States still reside in iron lungs . These generations are advancing , and it 's important that we not forget how horrible the crippling of polio can be to those who are at risk today . <p> The community of nations , health workers and funders have come very close to wiping polio off the map : in 1988 over 350,000 cases of polio were reported ; last year that number had declined to approximately 2,000 reported cases , afflicting mostly children under age 3 in just a few countries India , Nigeria , Afghanistan and Pakistan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eradication for decades , such as the Rotarians who have raised and given more than $600 million for polio eradication . Although the finish line is in sight , the global effort needs all of our support to reach the end goal . <p> Along with other efforts here , google.org is funding a documentary film with Vermilion Films Founder , and Emmy and 2007 Sundance award winner Irene Taylor Brodsky , to tell the story of the public health heroes on the front lines of polio vaccination and eradication . We 're hopeful this film will re-energize the group of dedicated donors and health workers to bring this campaign over the finish line . Throughout the project , Irene will share a few stories from the field . <p> And yes , welcome to the google.org blog . We are fortunate to be able to occasionally post to the Official Google Blog , and today we 're starting a blog of our own . We 'll invite posts by our team members and other Googlers about what they 're working on , and by our grantees and partners on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . We hope to include some of their reports and updates , as well as thoughts shared by guest bloggers.
