But weve only scratched the surface on the potential of the Web . Today , 5 billion people still do n't  have access to the Internet and the opportunity it provides.Google is doing work to get more people connected , especially in places where Internet access lags the most . In Sub-Saharan Africa , we 've created programs such as Google Apps Supporting Programs for Education , offered technical assistance such as caches for Internet providers , and generated ideas to build Internet capacity . To help bring the next billion people online , Google.org is announcing today our support of two organizations that share our mission to connect the world : the Network Startup Resource Center ( NSRC ) and the Internet Society ( ISOC ) . We are providing $3.1M to the NSRC to grow their work to bring local network engineering expertise to universities and national research &amp; education networks ( NRENs ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , NSRC will provide hands-on training on campus network planning , deployment , and management for over 600 university and NREN staff . Their work will bring the Internet to students and staff at over 50 institutions and increase network engineering know-how in Sub-Saharan Africa . <p> KENET-NSRC Campus Network Design Workshop , Photo : NSRC <p> Lesotho IXP setup . Photo Credit : ISOC/Michuki Mwangi <p> We are also supporting ISOC , providing $1.3M to improve and create Internet Exchange Points ( IXPs ) in emerging markets . IXPs play a big role in core Internet infrastructure , allowing Internet Service Providers to peer locally ( and cheaply ) , which can lower end user costs , promote competition , and improve user experience . ISOC will create a toolkit for those who want to create and improve IXPs and build an industry portal to share IXP information and data.Some of the brightest minds are working to improve lives in new ways through the Internet . By supporting the work of NSRC and ISOC , we can make sure that those opportunities are available to more people in more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Principal , Google.org <h> Thursday 2/14/2013 08:37:00 AM <p> " I am standing in a partial enclosure made of sticks and plant fronds . This is the school for roughly 35 students , ranging in age from three to about 20 years old . There are no desks . There is only a single shared chalkboard , and it has gaping holes . " David Rathmann-Bloch from the 21st Century Chalkboard Project , writing from rural Haiti . <p> These are just some of the many challenges faced by education organizations who applied for this years Google RISE Awards . The RISE ( Roots in Science and Engineering ) Awards program funds and supports organizations around the world that provide science and technology education at a grassroots level . <p> This year were delighted to give awards to 30 new organizations from 18 different countries . Combined they will reach more than 90,000 children in 2013 , helping inspire and teach the scientists and engineers of the future . <p> Others , like the U.K.s Code Club and the U.S.s CodeNow , offer extracurricular activities that help interested children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A few , such as the Middle Easts MEET and iLab Liberia , seek to use technology education as a platform to bridge wider social and cultural divides . <p> In addition to receiving funding and support to continue their outreach , RISE Award recipients will be brought together for a global summit this June in London . To paraphrase an old saying , from small seeds , great things can grow . The recipients of the 2013 RISE Awards have already made a difference . Connecting with other like-minded organizations will help spread valuable and practical expertise , and spark opportunities for global collaboration and expansion .
