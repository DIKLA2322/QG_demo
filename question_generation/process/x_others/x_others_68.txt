@@13269125 @1869125/ <h> Wednesday 9/12/2007 08:39:00 AM <p> Posted by Kirsten Olsen <p> Since Google.org launched the RechargeIT initiative in June as part of our efforts to stop global warming , a lot has happened in the world of plug-in vehicles . Automakers have made key announcements about future plans for plug-ins . Our grantee , the Electric Power Research Institute ( EPRI ) , along with Natural Resources Defense Council ( NRDC ) , released a comprehensive assessment that found that widespread use of plug-in hybrids could dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions . The charge for electrified transportation is heating up , and we could n't be more excited . But consumers still ca n't buy plug-in vehicles and that 's a problem . It 's time for us to put some money where our mouth is and help accelerate mass commercialization of plug-in vehicles . <p> Today , Google.org has issued a request for investment proposals ( RFP ) to the tune of $10 million in order to advance sustainable transportation solutions . We are inviting entrepreneurs and companies to show us their best ideas on how they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support technologies , products and services that are critical to accelerating plug-in vehicle commercialization . That is why we have structured this RFP to offer investment dollars to for-profit companies to promote social and environmental change . The severity of global warming requires solutions from NGOs , governments , individuals and ( very importantly ) the private sector . We have already made $1 million in grants to a group of outstanding non-profit organizations , and want to expand our impact by spurring innovation in the private sector . While $10 million is a fraction of the total investment needed to transform our transportation sector , we hope this RFP will help catalyze a broader response . We need the automakers to bring these cars to market , but plug-in vehicles also need an entire ecosystem of companies to flourish . <p> We realize that this type of open call for proposals is not the usual model for investment , but we wanted to use a process that was open to new ideas and new entrants . Part of our goal is to get as many people as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We welcome and expect to receive submissions from a wide variety of companies -- from cutting edge battery technologies to innovative service businesses and from companies of all sizes . We also encourage participants from all over the world to submit proposals . This is a global challenge , and it will take all of us to solve it . <p> This open RFP process is a new approach to mission-focused investing , and we 're interested to see what we can learn from it , both in terms of opportunities and gaps that exist in this space today , as well as ways that we can improve on this solicitation process for future investments . Our focus on learning is the primary reason we decided to narrow this first RFP to investments in private companies , rather than a combination of grants and investments . <p> We will continue to make grants as part of RechargeIT and other programs , but we 're excited today to announce our first foray into investments.To learn more , read the RFP.

Worldwide , organizations are developing new ways to encourage more open and innovative societies . Google.org is supporting two of these leaders--the Sunlight Foundation and mySociety--and their work on tech solutions for civic innovation.We are providing $2.1 million to the Sunlight Foundation to grow their programs for open government data , with a focus on making civic information for U.S. cities transparent , available , and useable .

This initiative can promote collaboration between civic-minded technologists , regardless of geography .

By creating these open platforms today , we can open doors to ambitious new solutions in the future.Posted by Matthew Stepka , VP , Google.org <h> Monday 1/14/2013 06:30:00 AM <p> One of the best parts about working at Google is the chance to use the Internet and digital technology to help us all manage energy better .
