The day 's speakers will include : <p> We chose to host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the region devastated by last years Great East Japan Earthquake - to focus this forum on Japans impressive disaster response and recovery efforts , which demonstrated some new and innovative ways that technology can aid the efforts of responders to reduce the impact and cost of disasters . <p> While hard hit coastal areas remain bare , with only foundation lines to mark the many homes that have been lost , and too many families still living in shelters or temporary housing , central Sendai and much of the Tohoku region are beginning to buzz with new life and commerce as the community rebuilds . There is still a lot of work to be done , but weve already learned a great deal from this region and the inspiring response and rebuilding work being done by people in Japan and around the world , and we believe there 's much more for Google , public and private sector leaders , NGOs and technologists to gain by coming together here . <p> For those interested in joining us in Sendai , please register to attend here .
