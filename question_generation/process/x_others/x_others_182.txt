No , not that one -- this film tells a true story . In honor of World Health Day , YouTube is highlighting The Final Inch , an inspiring short documentary created by Google.org and Vermillion Films about a group of dedicated health workers who are going door-to-door to give polio vaccines to children in the poorest areas of the world . You can watch the film here and embedded below . <p> In addition to hosting the film in its entirety on YouTube today , the film is also airing tonight at 7:15pm ET/PT on HBO2 and is available on HBO on demand . ( See the full HBO schedule here ) . <p> Since polio no longer exists in the developed world , many people assume the disease has been eradicated . Tragically , it has not . In the early days of Google.org , the team wanted to bring attention to the global challenge of polio eradication and tell the story of those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children under age 5 living in the world 's poorest , most remote regions . The result is a stunning 38-minute film which depicts the crippling disease and offers a hopeful account of the eradication effort . We hope the film will encourage those working hard on wiping out polio - and those who have forgotten it still exists - to bring the eradication effort over the finish line . <p> In 1988 , before the WHO eradication effort began , the polio virus was endemic in more than 125 countries , paralyzing more than 1000 children every day . Today , only four countries in the world are considered polio-endemic by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative ( Nigeria , India , Pakistan and Afghanistan ) and there are fewer than 1700 reported cases of polio . As the eradication effort closes in on the disease , the work becomes more difficult as polios strongholds remain in the worlds poorest countries which often lack the basic health infrastructure to distribute vaccine . <p> The millions of public health workers putting themselves on the front lines vaccinating children are the true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capture their story . We hope you enjoy the film ; but more importantly we hope that you 're inspired to contribute and advocate for the cause .
