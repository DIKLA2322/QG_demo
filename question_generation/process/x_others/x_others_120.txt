@@13269014 @1869014/ <h> Tuesday 8/31/2010 05:29:00 PM <p> Here in the U.S. I often take for granted the ability to immediately find information on if I might have a cold versus the flu or what vaccinations are recommended prior to traveling abroad . Like a lot of Americans , I often consult health information on the Internet in addition to talking with a medical professional . This information makes me more informed about my own health and more confident in making healthy decisions . <p> In most parts of the world , however , quality information that would help people improve their health is not available online in local languages . In fact , a 2004 Lancet article ( . pdf ) described the lack of access to health information as a " major barrier to knowledge-based healthcare in developing countries . " The authors noted that " among currently available technologies , only the Internet has the potential to deliver universal access to up-to-date healthcare information . " <p> To tackle this issue , we 're introducing a new initiative called Health Speaks which aims to help increase the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are beginning pilot projects to support community-based , crowd-sourced translation of health information from English into Arabic , Hindi and Swahili.We encourage anyone with health knowledge who is bilingual in English and either Arabic , Hindi or Swahili to take part in the pilot projects for Health Speaks . We have chosen hundreds of good quality English language health articles from Wikipedia that we hope will be translated with the assistance of Google Translator Toolkit , made locally relevant , reviewed and then published to the corresponding local language Wikipedia site . To further show our commitment to this cause , we have funded the professional translation of a small subset of these articles . <p> We are additionally providing a donation incentive to encourage community translators to participate . For the first 60 days , we will donate 3 cents ( US ) for each English word translated to the Children 's Cancer Hospital Egypt 57357 , the Public Health Foundation of India and the African Medical and Research Foundation ( AMREF ) for the pilots in Arabic , Hindi and Swahili , respectively , up to $50,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends and neighbors access quality health information in a local language , while also supporting a local non-profit organization working in health or health education . <p> We will undoubtedly learn from these three pilots and iterate on our approach as we learn how best to engage volunteers and provide tools that allow for easy and accurate translation . We hope to one day expand the Health Speaks initiative to include high-quality health content from other publishers and other languages that suffer from a lack of health information online . <p> According to UNESCO , 90% of the content on the Internet exists in only 12 languages . Language should not be the barrier that denies millions of people worldwide the opportunity to improve their health with valuable health information . Please join us in the effort to break down part of that barrier . <p> Update on 10/15 @ 10AM : We are excited to extend the donation incentive period for all three pilots to December 15 , 2010 . However , registration for new participants will close , as planned , on October 31 , 2010 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far . At our events in Egypt , India , Kenya and Tanzania we heard from so many people about the effect quality health information can have in their communities . We 've also received a great deal of feedback on the pilot and , as expected , will iterate on how best to crowd-source the translation of the health information . In the meantime , we 've decided to extend the donation incentive period because we know many community members have begun translating articles , but have not had enough time to complete and publish them . We hope the additional time will allow community members to complete the great work they have started so their communities can benefit . <h> Monday 8/30/2010 03:25:00 PM <p> Google PowerMeter now offers personalized energy savings recommendations to help you save more energy and show off your savings . You can find it under " Take action " in your Google PowerMeter page . <p> Over time , the feature will provide even more useful tips .

Collecting badges is a fun way of keeping track of your accomplishments to reduce energy waste and save money . And you might even strike up some friendly competition among family and friends to see who can collect the most badges the fastest ! <p> We 've also made it easier to see how much energy you 're using with a new display feature on the Google PowerMeter chart . Now , when you move your cursor over the chart , you 'll see a pop-up that shows the amount of power used at that moment in time . <p> Stay tuned as we continue to develop new features for Google PowerMeter . <h> Thursday 8/19/2010 04:12:00 PM <p> Today we celebrate World Humanitarian Day for just the second time , by honoring all those who participate in humanitarian work globally . August 19th marks the anniversary of the 2003 bombing of the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad , in which Sergio Vieira de Mello , the UNs Special Representative in Iraq , and 21 of his colleagues were killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Humanitarians often work in some of the least secure corners of the world . They face war , famine , disease and natural disasters . On this day , were honored to highlight all the work being done by our partners , and all organizations and individuals , who work to help global challenges . And we are reminded of how important it is to respond directly to the current flooding in Pakistan and the many humanitarian crises that continue today . <p> There are also many ways to have an impact on humanitarian crises from afar . In the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon Oil Rig explosion , for example , the Defenders of Wildlife ( and latest Google Earth Hero ) built the Gulf Oil Spill Recovery map to track restoration efforts from citizens , nonprofits and government agencies . <p> Humanitarian workers are deeply involved in solutions to the global challenges being addressed by the Millennium Development Goals . Recently the UN Secretary General issued a request for citizens around the world to become " Citizen Ambassadors , " giving people the opportunity to provide direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can participate : <p> Thanks again to all the organizations and individuals who help others . <h> Friday 8/13/2010 09:33:00 AM <p> Pakistan has been struck by the worst flooding in its recorded history . The latest estimate of the number of people affected by the flood exceeds 14 millionmore than the combined total of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami , the 2005 Kashmir earthquake and the 2010 Haiti earthquake . Critical infrastructure has been damaged over the last two weeks and clean water is in short supply . As monsoons approach , flooding is expected to worsen . <p> Our Crisis Response team has been working to use existing tools and build new ones to help the relief efforts . We just launched a page in Urdu and English where you can find information , resources and donation opportunities to help the victims of the floods . Were also donating $250,000 to international and local NGOs to immediately aid in relief efforts . Although we 've been able to provide satellite imagery for disasters in the past , cloud cover in Pakistan has prevented us from compiling useful imagery so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . <p> We 've already learned a lot about building useful tools from our previous efforts to help with disaster relief . Following the earthquake in Haiti , a small team of Googlers visited relief aid workers in Haiti to understand how we could further help . In observing and speaking with the relief aid workers , we learned that they needed up-to-date information about available resources ( such as which field hospitals have X-ray machines or orthopedic surgeons ) , their location and contact information . Coordination between various health and relief facilities that spring up in a disaster zone can be challenging . <p> Based on what we learned in Haiti , we 've been working to develop Resource Finder , a new tool to help disseminate updated information about which services various health facilities offer . It provides a map with editable records to help relief workers maintain up-to-date information on the services , doctors , equipment and beds available at neighboring health facilities so that they can efficiently arrange patient transfers . We normally would n't release the tool so quickly , but decided to make an early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Pakistan . This is the first time the tool is being launched during a disaster situation so well be working closely with NGOs to understand its usefulness and will iterate accordingly . <p> We 've also launched Person Finder in both Urdu and English for this disaster . This application allows individuals to check and post on the status of relatives or friends affected by a disaster . Fortunately , we 've heard that missing persons has not been as concerning an issue as it was during the earthquakes in Haiti and Chile , but well leave the application up regardless . <p> Responding to a disaster of this scale is a daunting task , but we can all do something to help . We will try to do our part and continue working with the many incredible NGOs to develop tools that help them work more effectively . <h> Thursday 8/12/2010 10:09:00 AM <p> I 've learned a lot as an intern with Google.orgs health efforts the last few months . Just this week I learned about a new collaboration between Google.org grantee HealthMap - the same group mentioned in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dengue Branch of the US Centers for Disease Prevention and Control ( CDC ) . Theyve created DengueMap to show recent reports of dengue around the world and regions where people are at risk to catch it . The reports on DengueMap are updated multiple times a day , keeping you up-to-date on where dengue is . <p> One week ago , I barely knew a thing about dengue . It turns out 2.5 billion people around the world are at risk of contracting dengue , and 50 to 100 million people get sick from it every year . Dengue is present in more than 100 countries , and dengue is on the rise in many parts of the world . This even includes the US . According to the CDC , there have been 28 cases where people caught dengue in Florida since 2009 . While this does n't  sound like a lot of cases , its somewhat alarming given that there were only a handful of cases ever recorded before 2009 . <p> Dengue thrives in both cities and rural areas of the tropics and subtropics and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The symptoms are similar to a severe flu , and can be quite painful . There is no cure and no vaccine . Fortunately , dengue rarely causes death , though severe complications , like dengue hemorrhagic fever , can be lethal . <p> The bottom line ? Be smart about protecting yourself from dengue . Know the areas where dengue is present ( DengueMap is helpful for this ) and wear bug spray . <p> Indeed , we believe our work in clean energy is good for business . We made the decision to become carbon neutral in 2007 . We are minimizing our energy consumption with some of the most energy efficient data centers in the world , lowering our energy costs . And we are purchasing carbon offsets for the emissions we cant eliminate . We also seek to power our facilities with renewable energy , like one of the largest corporate solar installations at our headquarters in Mountain View , CA . And were making investments in renewable energy , such as our $38.8 million investment in two North Dakota wind farms , and our recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year period , spurring real growth in the sector by giving the developer financial certainty to develop new projects . <p> As a technology company , we 've seen how the power of innovation can change the way we live our lives . Eric Schmidt said it best : " In Silicon Valley , it was the limitations of one technology or system that served as the drivers of change and led to the success of our industries here . AB32 provides a similar opportunity for new job creation in many sectors as business responds to the need for energy-efficient buildings , transportation and a growing portfolio of renewable energy resources . " <p> Were committed to finding the right solutions to a clean energy future and we hope Californias policies continue to lead the way . <h> Friday 8/06/2010 11:59:00 AM <p> According to the UN , the recent floods in Pakistan have affected over 4 million individuals - and the human toll continues to grow . Disease is an ever-increasing risk as relief agencies rush to the aid of those who have been hurt or displaced . <p> Googles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assist relief efforts in past disasters , including the Haiti earthquake and recent Gulf of Mexico oil spill . In Pakistan , however , the cloud cover over the impacted areas has inhibited our ability to make this valuable content available . The Crisis Response team is looking to collect and aggregate imagery and user generated KML , or other map data , with the goal of making this content more accessible to both crisis responders and the general public . Were hoping you can help . You can submit links to KML and map data via the following form . Well contact you if we are able to publish your content . <p> Further , we 've released a version of our Person Finder tool in Urdu . We realize many of the victims of this disaster lack any connectivity to the Internet , but remain hopeful that tools like this can assist the diaspora and general disaster community in collecting and dispersing information on the well-being of those impacted . <p> Your data might help relief efforts ; we appreciate you sharing it with the world .
