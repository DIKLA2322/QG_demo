On July 30 we will begin purchasing the clean energy from 114 megawatts of wind generation at the NextEra Energy Resources Story County II facility in Iowa at a predetermined rate for 20 years . Incorporating such a large amount of wind power into our portfolio is tricky ( read more about how the deal is structured ) , but this power is enough to supply several data centers . <p> The wind farm , which began operation in December 2009 , consists of 100 GE 1.5MW XLE turbines . <p> By contracting to purchase so much energy for so long , were giving the developer of the wind farm financial certainty to build additional clean energy projects . The inability of renewable energy developers to obtain financing has been a significant inhibitor to the expansion of renewable energy . Weve been excited about this deal because taking 114 megawatts of wind power off the market for so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renewable energy capacity for other customers . <p> We depend upon large quantities of electricity to power Google services and want to make large actions to support renewable energy . As we continue operating with the most energy efficient data centers and working to be carbon neutral , were happy to also be directly purchasing energy from renewable resources .

Its Ca n't Wait to Learn approach enables children to learn in informal refugee learning centres , places where there are not enough ( or no ) classrooms or teachers , and even in existing school systems . Ca n't Wait to Learn 's educational games on tablet computers supplement traditional education and ensure that students are able to advance academically . <p> Early research shows that students using the platform enjoy increased academic performance and self confidence . Through continuing to improve the interface and supporting adoption in other affected areas , War Child Holland and partners hope to expand these benefits to 170,000 children and beyond by 2020. @qwx162836 <p> Funding and technical expertise from Googler volunteers are helping War Child Holland and its partners turn their approach into a fully scalable , turnkey solution for student learning in conflict affected areas . Googler volunteers are also developing a comprehensive rollout plan for countries that want to deploy Ca n't Wait to Learn .

As a Kiwi now living in New York , I 've been anxious for everyone affected in New Zealand and simultaneously encouraged by how quickly people have come together to help . <p> We know that a lot of people are trying to contact the people they love and care about to make sure they 're OK ; we also know that during a time of crisis , it can be very difficult to reach people . <p> We have launched Google Person Finder to help people connect with their loved ones . Person Finder is a simple application which allows people to check on and update the status of relatives or friends affected by a disaster . <p> Working with a small team of Googlers in New Zealand and around the world , we also launched an informational page with maps , videos and other resources , including a real-time news stream .
