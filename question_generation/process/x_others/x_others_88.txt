@@13268979 @1868979/ <h> Monday 10/15/2007 07:57:00 AM <p> In partnership with Google.org , Technoserve recently completed the second Believe Begin Become program in Ghana , identifying 10 new winners of its annual business plan competition . As a Google volunteer , I had an opportunity to interact with this years participants by teaching a class on presentation skills , judging the final round of the competition , and conducting one on one consulting sessions . I also visited the growing operations of 3 winners from last year and saw firsthand how the Believe Begin Become program has contributed to the success of their business . <p> I was both impressed and humbled by every entrepreneur I met . They all exhibited a level of energy , passion and enthusiasm that was overwhelmingly contagious . Operating in an environment where sound infrastructure is not a given , poverty is a reality , and health issues abound , they are seeking to create and build sustainable businesses that will change their community and their country for the better . <p> This years top winner of the overall business plan competition , Sheila Ocansey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , embodies this energy and passion . With FrutyFresh , she plans to package and distribute quality fresh fruit to local Ghanaian professionals , families , and children . Sheila was thoughtful enough to bring a sample of her product to her oral presentation , something that impressed all of the judges . I craved FrutyFresh fruit for its freshness , quality , and taste throughout the rest of my stay in Ghana . The other top winners include : Darko Abednego , Stanley Adjei , Yaw Agyei-Henaku , Joseph Brenyah , Savior Deikumah , Nikoe Gavu , Mary Koranteng , Daniel Oduro , and Joseph Tettey . <p> I observed firsthand the promise of what is possible for this years winners through visits with three winners from last year . Nicholas Vordzgbe of City Wash launched his mobile car wash service using a highly profitable , environmentally friendly approach to a common activity . City Wash is capable of washing an SUV with just 2 liters of water ! His next move includes opening a point of service location and expanding his mobile activities . Isaac Bohulu launched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a room that should have been his master bedroom , he is running a government approved production facility for his flagship product , Neemfresh Herbal Mouthwash , made from completely natural ingredients . Finally , last years overall winner , Joseph Tackie of MeatyFoods , showed us how a shift in his marketing strategy allowed him to quintuple his revenues in one month . While we sampled the butchers spicy sausage , he told us of his plans to open his second store . <p> The Believe Begin Become program was launched with the hope that we would create an ecosystem of entrepreneurs , investors , customers , and employees that contribute to the growth and economic development of Ghana . Participating in the judging process , seeing the operations in action , and spending time with the entrepreneurs provided evidence that this is exactly what is happening . Participants from last year have become customers and/or suppliers of each other . Last years winner was a mentor to at least 3 of the winners from this year . The judges and potential investors have high standards ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are personally engaged and interested in their success . The program creates employment opportunities and causescapital to flow back into communities . With 120 alumni in the Believe Begin Become program , the newly-created alumni association will help fuel and expand on the already growing ecosystem that has been created .
