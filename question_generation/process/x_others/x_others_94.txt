" In 2004 , he organized the Copenhagen Consensus to have teams of economists recommend solutions to the worlds greatest problems . Experts were asked to assess what solutions provided the biggest bang for our buck in areas that spanned politics , economics , and the environment . Google.org adviser Lant Pritchett authored one of the ten " challenge papers " on education , and I did one on water and sanitation . The results were controversial not so much because of what was ranked at the top - HIV/AIDS - but because of what was at the bottom - climate change . <p> On Sunday May 25 , the Danish Prime Minister opened Copenhagen Consensus 2008 , the sequel . Lant Pritchett and I are back too . Lant authored one of two official critiques of the new Education challenge paper . Alix Zwane and I critiqued the 08 Water and Sanitation Challenge Paper by Dale Whittington and colleagues . In our contribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Harvard and UC Berkeley produced . This work , based on results from field work in Kenya , was funded by one of the first Google.org grants and shows that novel water treatment products ( one of which is marketed under the name WaterGuard ) for home use can be cost-effective ways to reduce diarrhea , a major cause of child mortality . In contrast to the research that Alix and I refer to , Whittington 's challenge paper is more pessimistic about whether water and sanitation interventions are the best use of scarce resources that are supposed to improve the lives of the poor . They base this claim mostly on the expense of the technologies they consider ( wells , piped water and sewerage ) . <p> In our review , Alix and I argue that a key reason that water services are not working for the poor is the same reason why other public services are failing the poor : a lack of accountability between providers , policymakers , and consumers that has resulted in bad management and governance . The best technologies in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premise of Google.orgs Inform and Empower Initiative . We believe that accountability is linked to information quality and information flows . Citizens and civil society can hold governments accountable if informed accurately of what is being done . Governments can do a better job of improving coverage levels if they know better where need is greatest . The Inform and Empower initiative supports activities that make this information available and actionable . <p> Tomorrow the panel of 8 economic experts , including 5 Nobel prize winners , will determine its ranking of the Copenhagen Consensus 08 solutions . In the meantime , you can determine your own ranking at Times Online . <p> Planned attendees include top bipartisan elected officials , including Senators Orrin Hatch , John Kerry , and Lamar Alexander , as well as Congressmen John Dingell and Jay Inslee . We 'll hear from FedEx CEO Fred Smith and New York Times columnist Tom Friedman . Speakers will include advocates , officials , and automakers from around the world . We hope you 'll join us . <p> Ca n't make it to Washington ? You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ videos , so grab a camera and tell us why you want to drive a plug-in . If you already own one , show us how it works . The videos will be displayed on our website and the best ones will be shown at the conference . We 'll also be webcasting the event for those that ca n't be there in person . <h> Monday 5/19/2008 02:02:00 PM <p> Posted by Katy Bacon , Google.org Team <p> Check out this video of Fortune Magazine 's Mark Gunther interviewing Dan Reicher . Dan explains the RechargeIT program , talks about the potential for vehicle to grid technologies , and discusses the future of electric cars . <p> To learn more about how to support disaster relief and recovery efforts , visit this microsite . To match funds generated by the site , we said we 'd donate up to $1 million to disaster relief organizations . Our first round of grants , totaling $600,000 , went through today via our donor advised fund at Tides Foundation to : <p> Responding to the tragic earthquake in China , many teams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful and current earthquake information . Examples include public service announcements on Google 's Content Network , a targeted forum on Google-Tianya , a search product to help locate missing loved ones , and an earthquake situation map with real-time detailed information on the different geographies , travel and road conditions to/from the region , and the latest disaster relief news and donation channels and contacts . In addition , Googlers across the world have organized relief activities such as blood donation and cash drives . Google.org will donate more than $1.5 million to on-the-ground relief organizations . Finally , tens of thousands of dollars of employee donations to non-profits have been matched by Google 's gift matching program .
