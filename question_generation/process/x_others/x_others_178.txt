As consumers embrace electric vehicles , weve also been adding information to Google Maps over the past few months to help users find charging stations . Just search on Google Maps for " ev charging station " plus the appropriate area , for example , " ev charging station near mountain view ca . " <p> We 'd like to continue adding more charging stations to Google Maps , so were excited that our friends over at the the U.S. Department of Energys National Renewable Energy Laboratory ( NREL ) are working to make more data available . <p> NREL has launched the GeoEVSE Forum to help develop a detailed , accurate database of electric vehicle charging stations . Well be adding more EV charging locations to Google Maps as their database , and others , are updated . As always , you can use the Report a problem tool to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an automaker , an electric vehicle charging station manufacturer or installer , an EV consumer group or any other interested party , you can join the GeoEVSE Forum by visiting this site . <p> We look forward to adding even more information to Google Maps to help you recharge your electric vehicle . Happy green driving !
