But a recent study issued by McKinsey &amp; Co. details just how compelling an opportunity we are missing . McKinsey predicts that an annual investment of roughly $50 billion over the next 10 years would cut energy demand by 23% and yield savings to the U.S. economy worth $1.2 trillion ! The energy savings would be equal to taking the entire U.S. passenger fleet of cars and trucks off the road . <p> Such efficiency gains are possible only if we overcome some major hurdles . For instance , most people have no idea how much energy we use in our homes on a daily basis or which of our appliances or devices are consuming the most energy . That 's one of the reasons that we created Google PowerMeter , a software gadget that shows users detailed information on their home electricity consumption . Studies show that when people have access to this kind information they reduce their energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if people use the information to buy a more efficient refrigerator or air conditioner , insulate their home , or take advantage of off-peak electricity rates . <p> The McKinsey report acknowledges that energy efficiency alone wo n't solve our energy and climate challenges . We must continue to put major resources into low-carbon sources of energy like renewable energy , and the federal economic stimulus , with its tens of billions of targeted dollars and incentives , is a good start . But the McKinsey findings are a wake up call . As we enact more comprehensive energy policies , energy efficiency -- and giving people the information , tools and incentives to take advantage of it -- should be front and center .
