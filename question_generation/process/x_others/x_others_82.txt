@@13268972 @1868972/ <h> Tuesday 6/30/2009 02:28:00 AM <p> Earlier today we announced on the Google Germany Blog that Yello Strom is our first Google PowerMeter partner in Europe . With over 1.4 million customers , Yello is among Germany 's ten largest electricity companies and the very first company to offer commercial smart meters nationwide in Germany . <p> When Yello Executive Director Martin Vesper gave us a demo of the Sparz+hler meter a few months ago , it felt like fate -- Yello 's solution for making energy information easy-to-access and easy-to-act-upon aligns perfectly with our vision for Google PowerMeter . The Sparz+hler meter 's broadband connectivity makes it possible for Google PowerMeter users to see 15 minute interval data nearly in real time . ( Its design is also pretty sleek , we think . ) <p> Google PowerMeter now has nine utility partners around the world , large and small -- and each partner shares our goal of giving customers easy access to their own home energy usage information . <p> We hear from utilities around the world that are interested in enabling their customers to use Google @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working with those utilities that can collect a minimum of hourly data ( that 's 24 reads a day ) and deliver it to Google within one day . If you work for a utility with these kind of capabilities and are interested in getting your customers Google PowerMeter , please let us know ! <h> Monday 6/29/2009 06:00:00 AM <p> Today is a big day for the Google Africa team for several reasons . We 're announcing an exciting partnership between MTN Uganda , the Grameen Foundation and Google , along with the launch of Google SMS in Uganda . This launch makes available the first suite of applications resulting from an endeavor initiated by Grameen Foundation called " AppLab " ( Application Laboratory ) which began over a year ago . AppLab is designed to develop mobile applications that serve the needs of poor and other vulnerable individuals and communities , most of whom have limited access to information and communications technology . <p> At Google we seek to serve a broad base of people not only those who can afford to access the Internet from the convenience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's important to reach users wherever they are , with the information they need , in areas with the greatest information poverty . Hence the launch of Google SMS , a bundle of mobile services for users to access content on a range of topics . This not only includes traditional services such as sports scores and local news , but for the first time , also includes services such as health and agriculture tips . <p> We are also releasing Google Trader , an SMS-based " marketplace " application that helps buyers and sellers find each other , enabling greater access to markets and trade , especially for those who are most excluded today . With these services , we hope to help alleviate some of the information and access to markets barriers for the poor , especially those in rural areas . So when farmers in Iganga want to sell their maize , they can list it on Google Trader and a miller in another trading center can find and contact them to buy their goods ( see picture below ) . If a pregnant woman has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question to 6001 and get a response right away . Now people in any part of Uganda can easily find the information that is most critical to them . <p> Miller in trading center calling women 's farming group in Iganga to obtain maize . <p> These activities also represent an important milestone : our first major initiative in Uganda , one of the newest locations where Google is setting up operations . Earlier this year , I joined the Google Africa team to lead our efforts in Uganda , where we want to offer valuable services that address real needs . As East African fiber optic cables begin to connect Uganda to the global Internet community , it is vital that the foundation for a thriving Internet economy also be established . Many impressive organizations are focused on this goal , and we hope to enhance these efforts . <p> Finally , this launch represents the team efforts of many local partners , communities and individuals , each of whom played a role in bringing this vision to life . The Village Phone Operators represent our very first set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the participation of farmers in more distant villages was fundamental in creating the highly local content created by them , for them , through our local partner BROSDI ( Busoga Rural Open Source and Development Initiative ) , in collaboration with AppLab . While developing the health tips service , students , health workers , doctors and school nurses stepped forward as leaders in their respective areas and turned this humble mission into a reality . Our partners , Straight Talk Foundation and Marie Stopes International , not only created the content with AppLab based on the input of these many constituents , but forged deep and strong links with the communities where these services are in greatest demand . <p> When we return to these villages with a product that will be developed through their insights , we want to understand if the service truly is having an impact . To this end , we are conducting a social impact assessment with Innovations for Poverty Action , with support from Google.org , to build from the knowledge of what users need most , to understand what works best . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizations already doing impressive work to reach a broader audience and those with the greatest need , in new and innovative ways , through the mobile phone . This is the first of many exciting collaborative efforts we will be working on to support access to information in Uganda and more broadly , across Africa . So to everyone who participated in this effort , we say Webale Nyo ! <h> 6/22/2009 08:19:00 AM <p> While many organizations are doing great work to enable community service locally , it 's not simple to search across opportunities from a variety of places to find what 's right for you . We have some experience finding relevant information from among many scattered sources , and when we learned that President Obama and the First Lady were making community service a top priority even before taking office , we thought we could help make a difference . <p> With our mission in mind , a group of " 20% " engineers , designers , and program managers from Google and other tech companies began work on All for Good , a new service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and share those events with your friends . <p> All for Good provides a single search interface for volunteer activities across many major volunteering sites and organizations like United Way , VolunteerMatch , HandsOn Network and Reach Out and Read . By building on top of the amazing efforts of existing volunteer organizations like these , we hope to amplify their efforts . <p> And in the spirit of open data , All for Good has a data API that anyone can use to search the same data displayed on the All for Good site . All for Good was developed entirely using App Engine and Google Base , with the full code repository hosted on Google Code Hosting . We 'll be inviting developers to contribute to the open source application soon , so stay tuned . <p> Just as releasing the Maps API led to an surge of independent and creative uses of geographic information , we 've built All for Good as a platform to encourage innovation in volunteerism , as much as an end product in itself . We hope software developers will use the API @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even better than the All for Good site ! <p> And if you want to volunteer your video-creating skills to make a difference , check out YouTube Video Volunteers , a new platform designed to make connections between non-profits with video needs and skilled video makers who can help broadcast their causes through video . <p> All for Good is a new kind of collaboration between the private , public , and nonprofits sectors to build free and open technology to empower citizens . Similar to the Open Social Foundation , we helped create a new organization called Our Good Works to make sure that the API , the platform , and social innovation that they inspire are supported for the long term . The leadership includes Reid Hoffman , Chris DiBona , Arianna Huffington and Craig Newmark on the board , and the organization aims to build support volunteerism services like All for Good . <p> Today the First Lady is in San Francisco calling on Americans to improve our communities by rolling up our sleeves and putting our time and talent towards doing good . You can learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search . <h> Friday 6/05/2009 11:24:00 AM <p> Today is World Environment Day and I wanted to point your attention to a major initiative that just launched and is supported by Google : The Prince of Wales ' Prince 's Rainforest Project , dedicated to protecting the Amazon rainforest . Check out this video featuring supporters from around the world , including Google 's very own CEO , Eric Schmidt - and some adorable frogs . Prince Charles spoke about the destruction of the rainforest and other challenges of the 21st century at our recent European Zeitgeist . As he has said , " If we lose the battle against tropical deforestation , we lose the battle against climate change . " <h> Wednesday 6/03/2009 07:01:00 AM <p> As the flu season begins in the southern hemisphere , we 're excited to announce the expansion of Google Flu Trends to Australia and New Zealand . <p> By using aggregated search data , we 've been able to produce estimates of flu activity for these countries in the same manner as in the United States and Mexico . We continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flu-related topics and how many people actually have flu symptoms . <p> While some existing flu tracking systems may take days or weeks to collect and release data , Google search queries can be counted immediately . Google Flu Trends is updated daily and may provide early detection of flu outbreaks . We hope that this information complements existing flu surveillance efforts in Australia and New Zealand , and proves useful for individuals and public health responders . <p> We 're keenly aware of the trust our users place in us and our responsibility to protect their privacy . Google Flu Trends can not be used to identify individual users . The patterns we observe are only meaningful across large populations of Google searchers . <p> For those Kiwis and Aussies out there , avoid becoming part of our statistics and get a flu shot ! And keep an eye on those graphs if you 're curious to see how the flu season unfolds.
