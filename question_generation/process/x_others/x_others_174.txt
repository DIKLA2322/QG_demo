On July 30 we will begin purchasing the clean energy from 114 megawatts of wind generation at the NextEra Energy Resources Story County II facility in Iowa at a predetermined rate for 20 years . Incorporating such a large amount of wind power into our portfolio is tricky ( read more about how the deal is structured ) , but this power is enough to supply several data centers . <p> The wind farm , which began operation in December 2009 , consists of 100 GE 1.5MW XLE turbines . <p> By contracting to purchase so much energy for so long , were giving the developer of the wind farm financial certainty to build additional clean energy projects . The inability of renewable energy developers to obtain financing has been a significant inhibitor to the expansion of renewable energy . Weve been excited about this deal because taking 114 megawatts of wind power off the market for so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renewable energy capacity for other customers . <p> We depend upon large quantities of electricity to power Google services and want to make large actions to support renewable energy . As we continue operating with the most energy efficient data centers and working to be carbon neutral , were happy to also be directly purchasing energy from renewable resources .
