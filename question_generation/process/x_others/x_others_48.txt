@@13269042 @1869042/ <p> Each year we review our Google Flu Trends models and may update them , if an update would make them more accurate when compared with the official influenza data we benchmark against . In this paper , we , together with a member of the US CDC influenza division , provide details of how the original pre-H1N1 Google Flu Trends model for the US performed in comparison with the updated Google Flu Trends model when compared against the CDCs ILINet ( Influenza-Like-Illness ) data . <p> Since the original Google Flu Trends model for the US was built using only seasonal influenza data ( pandemic flu data did n't  exist in the five years prior to 2009 ) , we did not know how Google Flu Trends would perform during an outbreak of pandemic flu . If the symptoms and complications of pandemic flu were similar to seasonal flu , we expected Google Flu Trends would be able to detect it . <p> Time series plots of ILINet data and original and updated Google Flu Trends estimates <p> A. ILINet data and Google Flu Trends estimates from 2009 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire time period where GFT estimates are available : 2003-2009 . <p> ( Click on image to enlarge ) <p> We found that while both the original and updated Google Flu Trends models performed well prior to H1N1 , the updated model performed better during H1N1--particularly during the first wave of H1N1 . Though generally getting the trend correct , the original model underestimated the magnitude of ILI activity during the H1N1 . Why was this the case ? In short , search behavior changed during H1N1 . This was especially true for the categories " influenza complications " and " term for influenza . " This is not unexpected , since differing complications and the fact that H1N1 began spreading during the northern hemisphere summer rather than winter likely played a role . It is interesting to see how the categories and examples of specific queries changed , though . For some specific examples , read the paper . <p> Were soon headed into flu season for the half of the world in the Northern hemisphere , so let 's stay healthy !

More than 200 goats from California Grazing have once again arrived at our Mountain View headquarters where theyll stay for over a week chomping away on grassy goodness .

If you can make it , RSVP here . <h> Friday 4/02/2010 12:22:00 PM <p> The international community likes to define Liberias recent history primarily through two events : its fourteen-year civil war , which ended in 2003 , and the work of the countrys president , Ellen Johnson Sirleaf , the first democratically elected female leader in Africa . The chart below illustrates both . On my recent trip to Liberia , first with a group of Bay Area philanthropists hosted by the government and then as part of a small group of Googlers on a country visit , I learned more about how terrible the 1980s and 90s were in this small West African nation . GDP -- a crude measure of the health of a nation , but an indicator nonetheless -- dropped 90% as the country endured brutal dictatorship after brutal dictatorship . That decline is the largest in any nation since World War II , and nearly twice the percentage drop that Rwanda , Zimbabwe , and other states experienced during their crises . The good news is that although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , GDP has almost risen to pre-conflict levels during Johnson Sirleafs tenure , and foreign direct investment has returned . <p> The numbers also tell a third story . Throughout the 1960s and 70s Liberias economy grew at a steady pace in a way that most other African economies did not . The growth was inequitable -- but real -- and the ingenuity and entrepreneurship that drove it are on full display today , albeit in ways that can sometimes puzzle a visitor to the country . <p> During the ten days I was in Liberia my colleagues and I always had a driver ; its the only way for foreigners to get around . The first day we reserved our car for 9:00am but when I looked out the hotel window at 9:02am I noticed the car speeding off with three other passengers . When I frantically called the driver he responded , " My man , do n't  worry -- I will get you to your meeting on time . " And he did . Then there was the night a local friend suggested dinner by saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outdoor patio at the base of Sniper Hill . . . wait , that did n't  quite sound as inviting as I meant it . " When we arrived our waiter was Frankie , a cheerful eight-year old sporting an Alex Rodriguez Yankees jersey who delivered our food and drink on the jog . At the local family restaurant , everyone pitched in . <p> Like most of Africa , cell phones are ubiquitous in Liberia and are the technology of choice for the vast majority of the population . Our meetings with the mobile providers there could have taken place anywhere in the world . They 're making money but are fiercely competitive with one another , slashing prices and offering new products to gain market share , and desperately trying to expand into new markets like broadband . Their activities are far from philanthropic , but they 're arguably having a more positive affect on Liberians day-to-day life than any other segment of society . The mobile penetration rate is 40% and rising , particularly in rural areas where phones are often the first " big " purchase a Liberian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course noticeable here as well . Liberians will often carry SIM cards from different mobile carriers and switch back and forth depending on coverage and prices ( a noticeably nice option that 's not available in the locked-down U.S. market ) . Since unanswered calls do n't  incur a charge and the person who initiates the call pays more than the receiver , Liberians will also occasionally call and hang up , meaning , " I want talk to you but you can afford this more than I can , so call me back . " Scratch cards , which give you twenty or thirty minutes of talk time , are practically used as cash and are sold virtually everywhere . <p> The past thirty years have been difficult ones for most Liberians , and with an 80% unemployment rate and known war criminals still occupying high government offices , there are still huge problems to address . In the next two years the country will hold elections and most of the UN peacekeepers will withdraw . Watch closely : if both go well , a stable Liberia may finally be back .
@@13269044 @1869044/ <h> Friday 1/28/2011 07:26:00 PM <p> Google.org continues to ramp up technology projects and test new ideas while Googles overall charitable giving , in-kind giving and employee volunteering have grown as well . Our newsletter outlines the latest updates to our philanthropic projects . I caught up with Megan Smith , VP New Business Development and General Manager of Google.org , to talk about how Google views philanthropy . <p> After two years at the helm of Google.org , what are you most optimistic about ? The Internet offers an opportunity to connect in ways never before possible . Things that have historically been far apart are now " virtually adjacent " most people are a text away , data sets can be mashed up , and all world knowledge is coming online from both expected and surprising sources . Given all of this , I am most excited about all the extraordinary ways people are using the web to connect , be informed , use data and to start solving problems together . <p> For Google.org specifically , we want to contribute our knowledge and skills to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have more than 50 engineers and about 40 other cross-functional Googlers working on four or five larger projectslike Google Crisis Response and RE&lt;Cand over a dozen smaller experimental pilot projects . <p> What kind of project fits this opportunity ? One of our newer projects , Google Earth Engine , takes advantage of Googles computing infrastructure to create a planetary sciences computation platform that could help reduce negative environmental impact at scale . The first focus is on deforestation monitoring . Earth Engine has just made it through the pilot phase to a full project with its launch last month at climate change talks in Mexico . If we meet our goals to enable global-scale monitoring of changes in the planets environment , I believe that Earth Engine could play an important information role in helping to slow deforestation . <p> What 's the biggest lesson you 've learned since joining Google.org ? Two things : first , the opportunity we have is great ; and second , the work has served as a reminder that creating truly useful , innovative technology is challenging and requires patient iteration , dialog , teamwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , learn from the right partners , collaborate , pilot those ideas that pass initial assessment and then launch for scale the few projects that meet the criteria for a Google.org product . <p> Do Google.org projects have a specific focus ? We do n't  have a topical focuswe work on technology solutions to many different kinds of global challenges . The key is to take advantage of Googles strengths . In the area of global health , for example , we have been able to create a global flu monitoring system based on search data . For our environmental work , we were able to leverage our data center computing power to put together the finest-scale forest map of Mexico to date ( processing this data would take two years on one computer , but we made it in less than 24 hours using our computing infrastructure ) . <p> How does Google.org start and ramp up its technology projects ? We work to tap into the talent at Google . Some projects have come out of hallway conversations and others from extensive talks with partners in the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with senior engineers where talented individuals or teams within Google bring ideas or prototypes . If we think the idea is a match and has promise , we give it budget , headcount , guidance and time to see where it can go during a pilot period . Once we have a live pilot or project , we take advantage of Google.coms standard project review and management processes that our company has effectively used for years . <p> What if those pilots fail ? That 's normal . We should expect that some of them will fail or will only have smaller impact . If you 're not failing some of the time , you 're not taking risks . As we progress , some of our failures will hopefully teach us as much as some of our successes . <p> What other charitable giving does Google do ? As a company that has been doing well , its important that we push ourselves to be amongst the most generous companies . We have several charitable giving programs supporting , for example , education ( especially K-12 science and math programs ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solutions for underserved groups . Last year the company gave more than $145 million to non-profits and academic institutions , and more than $184 million when including Google Grants , Google.org technology projects and in-kind product support for non-profits . <p> How is this philanthropic work different from that of other companies ? Like other companies , we have charitable giving programs , we provide products in-kind and we have a range of employee volunteering programs . Some companies like ours may also have experiments like Google.org to leverage their strengthsa form of skills-based giving . However , many companies do amazing charitable work through a centralized Corporate Social Responsibility arm that tackles a key issue or two . We approach philanthropy the way we do our core business , with big goals and a " launch early and iterate " approach . Ideas come from all over the company and we work to tackle a range of issues we care about , from clean energy to education to development . It may not be as clean as the process that some others have , but we think this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain determined , as our founders said when they set the vision for Google.org , " to find original ways to extend our assets , so that we can drive scalable , sustainable efforts . ... the underlying principle : Never stop looking for ways to do the best with what you have . " <p> Currently , for every well that sends cold water down to the hot rock ( called injectors ) , there are one to three wells that bring heated water back up to generate electricity ( called producers ) . But what if one well could act as both an injector and producer ? It could dramatically lower the cost of EGS ( example below ) . The Stanford team , which included graduate students Zhe Wang and Mark McClure , modeled a variety of single-well configurations to determine their feasibility . The investigation determined that on a per well basis , an optimal single-well EGS system would produce four times more energy than an isolated pair of wells and two times more energy than an infinite series of alternating producers and injectors . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , present another innovative technique for advancing baseload EGS on the path to RE&lt;C . <p> On a trip to Jerusalem three years ago , Jonathan Rosenbergvisited Yad Vashem . Struck by the museum 's vast historical record housed within the physical building , he hoped Google could do something powerful to showcase this information . Inspired by the challenge , a few of us , in our " 20% time , " started working with Yad Vashem and eventually grew our effort into a full project , introducing a YouTube channel in 2008 and now this collections site . <p> Within the archive you will find more than 130,000 images in full resolution . You can search for them via a custom search engine on Yad Vashems collections site . And by using experimental optical character recognition ( OCR ) , we 've transcribed the text on many images , making them even more discoverable on the web . This means that if you search for the name of a family member who was in the Holocaust , you might find a link to an image on the Yad Vashem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , try searching for the term rena weiser , the name of a Jewish refugee . You 'll find a link to a visa issued to her by the Consulate of Chile in France . OCR technology made this picture discoverable to those searching for her . <p> Yad Vashem encourages you to add personal stories about images that have meaning for you in the " share your thoughts " section below each item . Doron Avni , a fellow Googler , has already added a story . He found a photograph of his grandfather taken immediately after his release from a Nazi prison . His grandfather had vowed that if he should survive , he would immediately have his picture taken to preserve the memory of his experience in the Holocaust . He stitched the photo into his coat , an act that later saved his life . After hiding in the forest for a year , Russian soldiers mistook him for a German enemy , but released him once they saw this picture . <p> Dorons grandfather <p> The Yad Vashem partnership is part of our larger effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in similar projects in the past including digitizing major libraries in Europe , collections at the Prado Museum in Madrid , and the LIFE photo archive . We encourage organizations interested in partnering with us in our archiving efforts to enter their information in this form . <p> Were proud to be launching this significant archive that will allow people to discover images that are part of their heritage , and will aid people worldwide researching the Holocaust . <h> Friday 1/21/2011 03:00:00 PM <p> How can students hone their marketing skills and help an NGO at the same time ?

To support these efforts , we 've updated our aerial imagery in Google Earth of the Port-au-Prince area to include images from before and after the earthquake , as well as made updates throughout 2010 . These pictures provide an evolving view of the movement of people , supplies and rubble . <p> Complementing our online efforts with this imagery , a webpage and crisis response tools such as Person Finder , Google has made an effort to contribute to relief in Haiti by providing technical and financial support to NGOs . These organizations such as Doctors Without Borders and Partners in Health and specific technology NGOs such as Samasource and Frontline SMS continue to help the Haitian people . Weve looked to them to help us guide our ongoing response to this crisis . <p> In November , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave of Google teams to Haiti to evaluate our earlier response efforts and see where Google could continue to provide help .

We also ran training for aid workers on our collaborative tools like Google Apps , which can help coordinate resources . While there , we spent time understanding how NGOs are combating the cholera epidemic , and brainstorming tools that could help aid workers produce specialized maps of epidemic case data and chlorination levels at water points , which are critical for planning and prevention . <p> If you 're interested in helping with Googles efforts in Haiti , you can : <p> Our experience and the updated imagery demonstrate that there are still significant needs on the ground in Haiti .
