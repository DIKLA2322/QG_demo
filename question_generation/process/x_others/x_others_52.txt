Google has a data center in Council Bluffs , along with many employees that live in the city and surrounding region . <p> Along with our neighbors , we watched with concern as the Missouri River rose to a level not seen in decades . We are grateful for the extraordinary work of the City of Council Bluffs , Pottawattamie County , the Army Corps of Engineers and others who kept the city and much of the surrounding region safe . Our hearts also go out to those who have lost homes and businesses to the rising waters . <p> We recently worked with our satellite provider , GeoEye , to acquire updated imagery of some of the affected area . This imagery is now available as a KML file and will be live in the Historical Imagery section of Google Earth in the coming days . We hope that it will be of use to emergency responders and the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( before and after ) <p> Area between Council Bluffs/Omaha and Blair , Nebraska ( before and after ) <p> You can access all the new imagery by downloading the KML file and opening in Google Earth .
