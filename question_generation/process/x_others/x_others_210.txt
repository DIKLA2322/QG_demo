When we looked at our internal data a few months ago we were particularly saddened , although not entirely surprised , to find that the countrys Internet bandwidth -- a critical component of any modern economy -- was radically lower than that of its close neighbors . <p> At the request of the Clinton Foundation , and with some input from external experts like Inveneo , we recently came up with some ideas for improving access to the Internet in Haiti and wrote them up in this paper ( . pdf ) . They include opening TV or other appropriate spectrum for use , as the FCC recently approved in the United States , and different possibilities for connecting to undersea cables that would help make easy , cheap broadband connectivity a reality for Haitians . <p> These are some ideas to start the discussion . Multilateral institutions , entrepreneurs from around the globe , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role in helping the Internet grow there . We believe a stronger Internet means a stronger economy and democracy , and we hope this discussion will help Haiti succeed .
