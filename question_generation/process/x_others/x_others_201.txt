The population has swelled to 100,000 from approximately 70,000 largely because of refugees fleeing the post-election violence in other parts of Kenya . Local authorities expect to see that population double over the next ten years . Providing public services , especially water and sanitation , to this growing population is an enormous challenge . <p> In 2000 , the international community made a commitment to the UN Millennium Development Goals to help communities access basic public services , like health , education , water and sanitation . One the key milestones of Goal 7 is to " halve the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015 . " As of 2004 , the MDG Monitor shows the nations bordering Lake Victoria- Uganda , Tanzania and Kenya only 60% of their populations have access to improved drinking water sources . <p> While great progress is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60% of their population has adequate service , despite what the official statistics say . New water pipes have been donated to the local water provider . This has doubled the capacity , but it only reaches half of Kisii 's estimated population ( 50,000 ) . Water kiosks stand proudly along the main road . And yet , the taps run dry . The connections to the main line are not even functional . Young women still trudge the kilometers to the river , at risk to their own security , to collect water . Bright blue toilet stalls line the periphery of a girls school . While the school has seen an increase in attendance since the installation of these toilets , they continue to be plagued by their inability to deal with the sanitation requirements of their students . As we depart , the headmistress of the school pleads with us to help with the sanitation problem . <p> Some more recent data gathered from towns surrounding Lake Victoria in Uganda , Tanzania and Kenya , tell us a very different story than information from the MDG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us on the ground : while basic infrastructure ( water pipes , points , toilets ) may exist , those facilities are rarely functional , affordable or accessible , indicating to us that access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation services is substantially lower than many think . Presented with this information at a recent UN-Habitat meeting in Nairobi , international donors and development agencies were astonished . They asked , " how come we did n't know about this earlier ? " <p> And yet , unsurprisingly , the people of Kisii have long known that they do n't have appropriate water and sanitation services . They may not have even heard of the MDG 's . They are likely unaware of the conversations that transpire amongst donors and development agencies and help shape where resources are allocated . They are having their own conversations about what they need . But who can they tell ? Who hears their voices ? <p> Our challenge going forward is to help amplify these voices and contribute to efforts to inform these local discussions .
