Technology is helping people to connect , engage , and contribute to society and each other like never before.Weve seen developers use our Civic Information API to bring election data to citizens in new and exciting ways . Our live election results maps have been viewed by billions around the world , bringing real-time transparency to elections in Egypt , Mexico , Ghana , and more . Last week , we launched the Kenya Elections Hub for citizens to access the latest news and resources for the countrys presidential election . Beyond elections , technology can improve everyday civic life : the way we connect , engage , access and act on critical government information . Worldwide , organizations are developing new ways to encourage more open and innovative societies . Google.org is supporting two of these leaders--the Sunlight Foundation and mySociety--and their work on tech solutions for civic innovation.We are providing $2.1 million to the Sunlight Foundation to grow their programs for open government data , with a focus on making civic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By opening up information at the city level for developers as well as citizens , Sunlight is creating opportunity for new ideas that can have an impact in local markets.We are also supporting mySociety , providing $1.6 million to build a global platform to equip developers with tools and resources--such as open source code--to more easily and quickly launch new civic apps and services . This initiative can promote collaboration between civic-minded technologists , regardless of geography . For example , a civic app created in Finland might be easily replicated 9,000 miles away by a developer in Chile.Both organizations are working to bring together a larger community--governments , developers , companies , nonprofits , and citizens--with an interest in improving societies . By creating these open platforms today , we can open doors to ambitious new solutions in the future.Posted by Matthew Stepka , VP , Google.org
