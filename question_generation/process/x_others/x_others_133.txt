They committed resources from Google 's profits , equity and substantial employee time to this philanthropic effort , and they created the mission : " to use the power of information and technology to address the global challenges of our age . " They structured Google.org so that in addition to traditional grant making , it can also invest in for-profit companies , advocate for policies and , most important , tap into Google 's strengths : its employees , products and technologies . At first I was skeptical about " going corporate , " but I came on board convinced that Google could make real progress on these issues . I think we have made an excellent beginning , but it is just a very few steps on a long path . <p> Now , three years after Google.org was founded , we 've been reviewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's clear that I am most effective in helping to identify " big ideas " and potential partners , as well as raising awareness about society 's biggest challenges . I am therefore very excited to become Google 's Chief Philanthropy Evangelist . I think this is the highest contribution that I can make both to Google.org and to fighting the urgent threats of our day : from climate change to emerging infectious diseases , to issues of poverty and health care . By focusing my energy outwards I hope to be able to spend more time motivating policy makers , encouraging public and private partnerships , and generally advocating for the changes that we must make as a global society to solve these problems . Long-time Googler Megan Smith will take over day-to-day management of Google.org , joining as General Manager to lead us through this transition , in addition to her existing role as Vice President of New Business Development . <p> One of the first things that Megan will focus on is how Google.org can best achieve its mission . During our review it became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkable non-profit organizations over the past three years , our greatest impact has come when we 've attacked problems in ways that make the most of Google 's strengths in technology and information ; examples of this approach include Flu Trends , RechargeIT , Clean Energy 2030 , and PowerMeter . By aligning Google.org more closely with Google as a whole , Megan will ensure that we 're better able to build innovative , scalable technology and information solutions . As a first step , Google has decided to put even more engineers and technical talent to work on these issues and problems , resources which I have found to be extraordinary . In this global economic crisis , the work Google.org is doing , together with our many colleagues around the world , to help develop cheap clean energy , find and fight disease outbreaks before they sweep the globe , and build information platforms for underserved people globally , is more important than ever . We stand behind the commitment made in 2004 to devote 1% of Google 's equity and profits to philanthropy , and we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our resources have the greatest possible impact for good . <h> Wednesday 2/18/2009 11:24:00 PM <p> Just one week after launching Google 's energy information campaign , we kicked off our first joint smart grid event with GE , a larger clean energy collaboration we announced last fall . Our timing was fortuitous ; the event took place just as President Obama signed an historic economic stimulus bill that includes $11 billion to modernize the electricity grid . <p> Getting energy information into the hands of consumers requires reworking the electricity grid to make it smarter . At yesterday 's event , hosted in Google 's Washington office , experts explored what the fundamental elements of a smarter grid should be -- from empowering consumers with information , tools , and choices to manage their energy use , to creating an open system that encourages innovation , to enabling a massive scale up of renewable energy sources and plug-in vehicles . We also explored the government 's role in accelerating these efforts . Our panelists were enthusiastic about the opportunity created by the stimulus , but also noted the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an effective and efficient manner . <p> Historically such funding has been anemic . After a peak in 1978 of $7 billion , U.S. government funding for energy RD&amp;D dropped by more than 70% . Corporate RD&amp;D fell even more , and funding in the early 2000s totaled just 0.3% of sector revenue , compared to 15% in the biotech sector . Is it any wonder the energy sector has struggled to make progress ? <p> What level of energy RD&amp;D funding is needed ? Kammen and Nemet look at several different metrics and suggest that a sustained level between $20-40 billion is needed to reinvigorate the field . Recent activities push in the right direction : 2008 funding reached $3 billion , 50% higher than during the early 2000s , and the stimulus bill recently signed into law adds $3.25 billion in new RD&amp;D funding for clean energy . But to have a truly transformative effect , investment needs to climb even higher . <p> In addition , without emphasizing the " R " in RD&amp;D , we will produce only incremental improvements . We need to prime the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce radically better ( and cheaper ) technologies . This will provide long-term job growth , and also increase consumers ' buying power , stimulating the economy . <p> Funding must also be coupled with long-term demand for clean technology . This gives companies confidence their investments will pay out , and assures students entering the field that jobs wo n't evaporate . Research must also focus more on clean tech ; in recent years only 40% of energy RD&amp;D funding has gone to renewable energy and energy efficiency . <p> At Google we 've learned some that might be successfully applied to energy : <p> " Put the user first and all else follows . " For instance , customers care about saving money , but only if it 's easy to measure . Providing ways to cheaply monitor energy consumption is a powerful first step . <p> " Great just is n't good enough . " Cost-parity for renewables is required for long-term competitiveness , but to replace conventional technology we must develop renewable electricity cheaper than coal , the least expensive fossil fuel . <p> " Launch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , get new technologies into the marketplace quickly , then improve through iteration . <p> These strategies will make sure that the widest possible set of ideas are considered , increasing the number of breakthroughs . A " fail fast " policy would allocate people to the great ideas , with high-impact results guaranteeing continued funding , particularly at the critical demonstration stage where many technologies fail to attract sufficient capital . Carrying projects over this " Valley of Death " to full commercialization will ultimately result in the best , lowest-cost technologies rapidly reaching the market . For the sake of the planet , clean energy ca n't arrive soon enough . <h> Thursday 2/12/2009 01:06:00 PM <p> A guest post from Howard White , Executive Director , International Initiative for Impact Evaluation : <p> In the foreign aid business , it 's very important to answer the question , " Was this a successful project ? " because donors need to know where to target their scarce resources . Unfortunately , the answer to this question has frequently been , " Well it must be , we spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This problem has been most recently highlighted by the Centre for Global Developments report , " When Will We Ever Learn ? " . Billions of dollars are spent on development interventions each year with little evidence on whether they work or not . <p> I started my own academic career looking at aid impact at the macroeconomic level . In my own defense , I can say that , starting with my PhD , I criticized the over-aggregated cross-country regression approach , arguing instead for careful country-level analysis of macro impact that could pick up on both context but also the many channels both money and ideas through which aid affects development outcomes . Having published a couple of widely ignored books pursuing this approach , I became increasingly convinced that aid impact had to be examined from the bottom up . That is a systematic analysis of , if not all interventions , then enough to be able to make authoritative statements about whether the aid program is working or not . This might seem like a lot of work ; but then so is measuring GDP and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to implementing a bottom up approach . The first is that evaluation design is often poor when it comes to measuring impact . The second problem is that most agencies do not systematically compile evidence across interventions . It is symptomatic of a culture of producing evaluations as a bureaucratic requirement , not as a management or learning tool . <p> It is to tackle these two problems - the lack of evidence and the failure to synthesize what evidence there is into policy-relevant lessons that the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation ( 3ie ) has been created . Google.org has been one of our early funders . <p> The bulk of 3ie funding is going to help expand our knowledge about what works by supporting new impact studies , focusing on what we call the enduring questions of development . We are in the process of a consultative exercise to identify these questions to which you can contribute by visiting our website . We will also have an open window for studies on other topics , for which the first request for proposals went out recently . Please visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2/09/2009 09:07:00 PM <p> Imagine how hard it would be to stick to a budget in a store with no prices . Well , that 's pretty much how we buy electricity today . Your utility company sends you a bill at the end of the month with very few details . Most people do n't know how much electricity their appliances use , where in the house they are wasting electricity , or how much the bill might go up during different seasons . But in a world where everyone had a detailed understanding of their home energy use , we could find all sorts of ways to save energy and lower electricity bills . In fact , studies show that access to home energy information results in savings between 5-15% on monthly electricity bills . It may not sound like much , but if half of America 's households cut their energy demand by 10 percent , it would be the equivalent of taking eight million cars off the road . <p> Googles mission is to " organize the worlds information and make it universally accessible and useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detailed information about their home electricity use . We 're tackling the challenge on several fronts , from policy advocacy to developing consumer tools , and even investing in smart grid companies . We 've been participating in the dialogue in Washington , DC and with public agencies in the U.S. and other parts of the world to advocate for investment in the building of a " smart grid , " to bring our 1950s-era electricity grid into the digital age . Specifically , to provide both consumers and utilities with real-time energy information , homes must be equipped with advanced energy meters called " smart meters . " There are currently about 40 million smart meters in use worldwide , with plans to add another 100 million in the next few years . <p> But deploying smart meters alone is n't enough . This needs to be coupled with a strategy to provide customers with easy access to energy information . That 's why we believe that open protocols and standards should serve as the cornerstone of smart grid projects , to spur innovation , drive competition , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We believe that detailed data on your personal energy use belongs to you , and should be available in an open standard , non-proprietary format . You should control who gets to see your data , and you should be free to choose from a wide range of services to help you understand it and benefit from it . For more details on our policy suggestions , check out the comments we filed yesterday with the California Public Utility Commission . <p> In addition to policy advocacy , we 're building consumer tools , too . Over the last several months , our engineers have developed a software tool called Google PowerMeter , which will show consumers their home energy information almost in real time , right on their computer . Google PowerMeter is not yet available to the public since we 're testing it out with Googlers first . But we 're building partnerships with utilities and independent device manufacturers to gradually roll this out in pilot programs . Once we 've had a chance to kick the tires , we 'll make the tool more widely available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with detailed energy information . And it will take the combined efforts of federal and state governments , utilities , device manufacturers , and software engineers to empower consumers to use electricity more wisely by giving them access to energy information .
