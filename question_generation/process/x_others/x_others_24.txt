@@13268866 @1868866/ <h> GiveDirectly <h> Overview <p> Creating opportunity through mobile cash transfers <h> What they do <p> Studies suggest that 700 million people around the world live in extreme poverty . People who are fighting for immediate essentials are rarely able to invest in their future . And unfortunately , many nonprofits designed to offer set types of goods and services are n't able to meet the unique needs of individual recipients . <p> GiveDirectly has very a different idea : that the most effective way to have a long-term impact on poverty is to give people a basic starter income with no strings attached . Funds are delivered via simple mobile transfers . Recipients can then invest the money in whatever is most pressing - whether that be planting crops , replacing a roof or sending their kids to a better school . No matter the decision , GiveDirectly meticulously tracks each donation in order to ensure that the aid is being spent effectively . <p> All this data collection has also produced a larger revelation . GiveDirectly 's ongoing research shows that letting the poor be their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poverty , but has a ripple effect that influences everything from agriculture and labor practices to education and women 's rights . @qwx162836 <p> Google.org saw so much potential in GiveDirectly 's research that we gave them a $2.4 million grant in 2012 . The grant helped the organization scale direct cash transfers to more Kenyan families and duplicate its program in Uganda . Two years later , a second round of funding enabled GiveDirectly to expand to additional countries in East Africa as well as conduct a study in Western Kenya that examined the macroeconomic , communal , social , and psychological impact of their cash transfers .
