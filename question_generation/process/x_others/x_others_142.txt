@@13269040 @1869040/ <h> Tuesday 10/27/2009 08:08:00 PM <p> Electricity consumers in the United Kingdom can now access Google PowerMeter , a free software tool that provides consumers with information on how much energy their home is using . The software receives information from utility smart meters and in-home energy management devices and visualizes this information on a personalized iGoogle homepage . Today we 're announcing both our very first UK utility partnership and our very first UK device partner . <p> Our utility partner , first:utility , is the only energy supplier in the United Kingdom to provide free smart meters to its customers , and is currently in the process of rolling them out across the country . To date , first:utility has over 30,000 customers signed up to its service . Starting in early November , all first:utility customers with smart meters will be able to sign up to use Google PowerMeter , empowering them with greater information about their home electricity use . According to Mark Daeche , first:utilitys Chief Executive , " At the end of the day , if you ca n't measure and view your energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Google is also partnering with AlertMe , a self-install consumer device manufacturer and our first partner with a product available in the United Kingdom . Starting today , AlertMe customers in the UK can access their homes data through Google PowerMeter on their iGoogle homepage . In just a few minutes consumers can access their home energy data from anywhere they can access the Internet . Pilgrim Beart , founder and CEO of AlertMe noted , " Our partnership with Google PowerMeter puts your home energy consumption right in front of you every time you go online . " Check out this video to learn more about how you can start monitoring your home energy use today . <p> With today 's announcement , we 've now signed up two device partners and ten utility partners serving five countries ! <h> 10/27/2009 11:53:00 AM <p> President Obama today announced $3.4 billion in federal stimulus funding to build a " smarter " electricity grid . The funds are the largest single energy grid modernization investment in U.S. history , according to the Department of Energy , and are expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited because the vast majority of the projects will benefit consumers directly by giving them tools and information to save energy and cut utility bills . For example , the Sacramento Municipal Utility District will receive $127 million to install 600,000 smart meters and 50,000 programmable thermostats and home energy management systems . Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company will receive $130 million to provide 771,000 meters to 100% of its customers . These technologies will enable consumers to receive direct feedback on their energy use , which can lead to energy savings of up to 15% on average . Altogether the awards will fund the installation of 18 million smart meters , 1 million in-home energy displays and 170,000 smart thermostats . <p> With the advent of smart meters and other information technologies , we have the opportunity to rebuild the electricity grid , which still uses century-old technology in places . Most importantly , we can make the grid work better for consumers . Today 's announcement is an ambitious step toward that goal . <h> Monday 10/26/2009 09:11:00 AM <p> The first outbreak of the new " swine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year in Mexico caught the world by surprise . Public health officials around the world tried to stop the virus at the borders but were largely helpless . Shortly after , on the other side of the world from Mexico , I saw the health check posts in Cambodia at the airport and at a borderpost with Vietnam , right when the country found its first H1N1 cases which were flown in by US exchange students . The weapons used by the health officials to combat the spread of the virus were primarily paper survey forms and thermometers ; the virus won , very quickly . Genomics is rapidly changing both the way diseases are diagnosed and the way medications and vaccines are developed - but will it give us the tools to prevent the next pandemic ? <p> What if countries where emerging infections originate , from Cameroon to Cambodia , could rapidly sequence suspect samples and discover new pathogens when only a few people have become sick ? <p> What if all such sequence data were immediately shared in a single global open access database ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data and all associated data , annotations or publications as easily and effectively as a Google search ? <p> What if markers discovered for a new disease would quickly be incorporated into affordable hand held multi-pathogen diagnostic tests widely available at the point of care ? <p> What if the results of those tests were uploaded to a database where surveillance tools like Google Flu Trends could discover outbreaks ? <p> Today the Public Library of Science , a mission driven , non-profit and open access publisher , presents " The Genomics of Infectious Disease " a collection of essays , perspectives and reviews that explores how genomicswith all its associated tools and techniquescan provide insights into our understanding of emerging infectious disease . This collection was produced with financial support from Google.org with the editorial independence and rigor of PLoS and the expert opinion of leading researchers . <p> In one piece Rajesh Gupta , Mark Michalski ( of Stanford , but at Google.org last year ) and I provide Google.orgs perspective and vision for how systematic application of genomics , proteomics , and bioinformatics to infectious diseases could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision , however , we feel that a focused , coordinated and scaled-up effort would be required . We urge the community to unite under an " Infectious Disease Genomics Project , " analogous to the Human Genome Project , to accelerate today 's impressive progress as reviewed by this cross-journal open access collection . <h> Thursday 10/15/2009 04:36:00 PM <p> As a relatively new philanthropy ourselves , Google.org continues to explore innovative and sustainable solutions to improving the lives and livelihoods of people in the developing world . This exploration often brings us into dialogue with many start-up social enterprises and other philanthropies trying to overcome challenges working directly with less advantaged populations . One such group , LGT Venture Philanthropy , has articulated a recurring theme : organizations with effective and innovative solutions to social and environmental problems often lack the manpower and expertise to implement these solutions in the most effective way , especially during the growth phase . They have come up with a creative solution : the iCats Program . <p> The iCats Program was designed to bridge the gap between philanthropic organizations or social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business professionals with the desire to apply their knowledge and experience to benefit the social sector , thus acting as " impact catalysts . " This is how the name iCats was inspired . <p> iCats are professionals from all over the world with diverse professional backgrounds who are willing to share their business expertise with carefully selected philanthropic organizations and social enterprises . LGT Venture Philanthropy created a web-based platform to match experienced professionals with specific needs in trusted partner programs . <p> In 2009 , eight fellows are working in organizations in Africa , India , and Latin America . Peter Shrimpton , CEO of Heart in Capetown notes of the iCAT program , " Your funds may have mobilized us , but it is your fellows who are optimizing our performance . If your funds are the vehicle , your fellows are the fuel . " <p> I wanted to share with you that applications for the 2010 iCat Program are now underway . A fellow works 11 months on-site with a portfolio organization from February to December 2010 and receives regular mentoring from the LGT Venture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings all fellows together in the Swiss mountains . <p> The fellow positions for 2010 are now online on www.icatsprogram.com . Application deadline is 26th October 2009. <h> 10/08/2009 12:35:00 AM <p> If you 're like us , you 're probably thinking a lot about how this year 's flu season might affect you and your community . To help you out , we at Google.org are excited to announce the expansion of Google Flu Trends to 16 additional countries , including much of Europe . We 've also made the site available in 37 languages . Flu is a global threat , affecting millions worldwide each year , so we 're pleased to make this tool available in more regions and languages . <p> Last November , we launched Google Flu Trends in the United States after finding a close relationship between how many people search for flu-related topics and how many people actually have flu symptoms . By tracking the popularity of certain Google search queries , we are able to estimate the level of flu , in near real-time . While some traditional flu surveillance systems may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Google search queries can be counted immediately . Google Flu Trends provides an additional surveillance tool that may help public health officials and the public make more informed decisions about preparing for the flu season . <p> In the past year , we 've expanded our coverage to include Mexico , New Zealand and Australia and have continued to see a good correspondence between our estimates and official flu activity data . In fact , our analysis of last season shows that Google Flu Trends had a close 0.92 correlation with official U.S. flu data . <p> An important aspect of Google Flu Trends is that we filter out terms that may be popular because people hear about them in the news . What we do not use in the models is a term like swine flu since people are more likely to type that into Google because they want to know more information about it , given the news headlines , and not because they actually have H1N1 or swine flu . For more information about how we built this model , take a peek at this video : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll notice that the flu season is starting early this year . For tips on how to stay healthy this season , please visit our friends at the U.S. CDC and the ECDC . <h> Wednesday 10/07/2009 05:09:00 PM <p> The Google PowerMeter team is pleased to announce an important milestone for our product -- open enrollment . This means that utilities can enable self-serve sign-up for customers to use the Google PowerMeter gadget . More users means improved feedback on our product and this will translate into an improved product experience . Here 's how it works : If your utility has open enrollment enabled for your account , with just two simple steps you can have your usage data transmitted to Google and visible online via Google PowerMeter . <p> Yello Strom , a German utility and our first partner in Europe , is fully up and running with open enrollment . All of the customers who use Yello 's smart electricity meter - the Sparz+hler - can now also view their individual electricity consumption online using Google PowerMeter . With over 1.4 million customers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very first company to offer commercial smart meters nationwide in Germany since 2008 . Yellos smart meter interacts with a PC to make energy consumption visible for the customer both in real-time within their own household and online at fifteen-minute intervals . Expanding the number of customers who can sign up for Google PowerMeter is just one more way this forward-thinking utility is improving access to energy information . As Executive Director Martin Vesper put it , " We are now offering our customers even more ways to maintain an overview of their electricity consumption with the help of the internet . And when people know exactly what is going on with their energy usage , they can use energy efficiently without sacrificing convenience . " <p> Other Google PowerMeter partners are also working towards open enrollment capabilities . Florida 's JEA has built an open enrollment system and is actively rolling it out within their customer base . And National Information Solutions Cooperative ( NISC ) , the latest addition to our strategic partners , is actively integrating Google PowerMeter into their offerings for all Utility Co-ops that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcement mean that even more users can now see their electricity data to save energy and money ! <h> Monday 10/05/2009 03:43:00 PM <p> Today , we 're very excited to announce we have secured our first official device partner . ( That means having a smart meter installed by your utility is no longer a prerequisite for using Google PowerMeter ! ) For the last several months , a few hundred Google employees have been testing a number of in-home electricity monitoring devices . Those of us lucky enough to have one of these devices installed in our homes experienced first-hand how access to high-resolution energy use information drives meaningful behavior change . So we set out to make that data easier for everyone to access and understand by sending the collected data to our Google PowerMeter software . <p> Combined with Google PowerMeter , the TED 5000 device can help you understand your electricity usage to save energy and money . Energy Inc. is just our first device partner and if you are working for a company that manufactures energy monitors , we 'd like to hear from you . Stay tuned for more !
