Today , in 13 countries , well begin displaying some combination of special search results for searches around poison control , suicide and common emergency numbers that point to emergency information . <p> This effort started last year when I received an email from a mother in the U.S. who had trouble finding the phone number for the poison control hotline after her daughter accidentally ingested something potentially poisonous ( fortunately , her daughter was fine ) . As a result , people in the U.S. performing various searches including " poison control " began to see a special result displaying the national phone number for the American Association of Poison Control Centers last fall . <p> Example of the poison control result in Spain <p> Soon after we added poison control information to search results , we heard from Googlers whose lives had been affected by suicide and who thought that suicide prevention could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we began prominently displaying the number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at the top of the results page for certain search queries in the U.S. Since then , our friends at the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline have reported a 9 percent increase in legitimate calls to its hotline . <p> Example of the suicide prevention result in the UK <p> So , following positive feedback from consumers and our hotline partners , we decided to expand the poison control and suicide prevention special search results beyond the U.S. Each of these 13 countries will see one or more of these results : Australia , Belgium , France , Germany , Hungary , Italy , Netherlands , New Zealand , Norway , Spain , Sweden , Switzerland and the United Kingdom . We looked for hotlines that are available nationally and 24/7 and we hope to add additional countries in the future . <p> We 're also introducing a new special search result for common emergencies , such as fire , medical and police emergencies . We want to make this information easier to find for residents as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different emergencies . <p> Example of the emergency number result in France <p> An emergency is stressful enough . We hope this small step helps connect people with the information they need immediately .
