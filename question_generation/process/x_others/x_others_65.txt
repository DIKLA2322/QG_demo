Today , the National Geographic Enduring Voices YouTube channel will launch and allow many of these tongues to have a presence on the Internet for the very first time . Linguists Dr. K. David Harrison and Dr. Gregory Anderson from the Living Tongues Institute have teamed up with Google.org to allow small and endangered languages that may have never been heard outside of a remote village to reach a global audience . Using YouTube as a platform , researchers , academics and communities can now collaborate more effectively on promoting language revitalization . <p> The launch of the channel comes on the heels of an announcement by Harrison and Anderson of a " hidden " language of India , known locally as Koro , that is new to science and had never been documented outside of its rural community . Koro is one of half of the worlds languages likely to vanish in the next 100 years . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also seeing a global grassroots movement for language revitalization . Speakers are leveraging new technologies , such as social networking and YouTube , to sustain small languages . As Harrison describes in his book " The Last Speakers , " we are all impoverished when a language dies , and all enriched by the human knowledge base found in the world 's smallest tongues .

" In 2004 , he organized the Copenhagen Consensus to have teams of economists recommend solutions to the worlds greatest problems . Experts were asked to assess what solutions provided the biggest bang for our buck in areas that spanned politics , economics , and the environment . Google.org adviser Lant Pritchett authored one of the ten " challenge papers " on education , and I did one on water and sanitation . The results were controversial not so much because of what was ranked at the top - HIV/AIDS - but because of what was at the bottom - climate change . <p> On Sunday May 25 , the Danish Prime Minister opened Copenhagen Consensus 2008 , the sequel . Lant Pritchett and I are back too . Lant authored one of two official critiques of the new Education challenge paper . Alix Zwane and I critiqued the 08 Water and Sanitation Challenge Paper by Dale Whittington and colleagues . In our contribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Harvard and UC Berkeley produced . This work , based on results from field work in Kenya , was funded by one of the first Google.org grants and shows that novel water treatment products ( one of which is marketed under the name WaterGuard ) for home use can be cost-effective ways to reduce diarrhea , a major cause of child mortality . In contrast to the research that Alix and I refer to , Whittington 's challenge paper is more pessimistic about whether water and sanitation interventions are the best use of scarce resources that are supposed to improve the lives of the poor . They base this claim mostly on the expense of the technologies they consider ( wells , piped water and sewerage ) . <p> In our review , Alix and I argue that a key reason that water services are not working for the poor is the same reason why other public services are failing the poor : a lack of accountability between providers , policymakers , and consumers that has resulted in bad management and governance . The best technologies in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premise of Google.orgs Inform and Empower Initiative . We believe that accountability is linked to information quality and information flows . Citizens and civil society can hold governments accountable if informed accurately of what is being done . Governments can do a better job of improving coverage levels if they know better where need is greatest . The Inform and Empower initiative supports activities that make this information available and actionable . <p> Tomorrow the panel of 8 economic experts , including 5 Nobel prize winners , will determine its ranking of the Copenhagen Consensus 08 solutions . In the meantime , you can determine your own ranking at Times Online .

Public health officials around the world tried to stop the virus at the borders but were largely helpless . Shortly after , on the other side of the world from Mexico , I saw the health check posts in Cambodia at the airport and at a borderpost with Vietnam , right when the country found its first H1N1 cases which were flown in by US exchange students . The weapons used by the health officials to combat the spread of the virus were primarily paper survey forms and thermometers ; the virus won , very quickly . Genomics is rapidly changing both the way diseases are diagnosed and the way medications and vaccines are developed - but will it give us the tools to prevent the next pandemic ? <p> What if countries where emerging infections originate , from Cameroon to Cambodia , could rapidly sequence suspect samples and discover new pathogens when only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such sequence data were immediately shared in a single global open access database ? <p> What if you could search for a string of sequence data and all associated data , annotations or publications as easily and effectively as a Google search ? <p> What if markers discovered for a new disease would quickly be incorporated into affordable hand held multi-pathogen diagnostic tests widely available at the point of care ? <p> What if the results of those tests were uploaded to a database where surveillance tools like Google Flu Trends could discover outbreaks ? <p> Today the Public Library of Science , a mission driven , non-profit and open access publisher , presents " The Genomics of Infectious Disease " a collection of essays , perspectives and reviews that explores how genomicswith all its associated tools and techniquescan provide insights into our understanding of emerging infectious disease .

To realize this vision , however , we feel that a focused , coordinated and scaled-up effort would be required .
