On our energy-monitoring software tool , Google PowerMeter , this shows up as a dark green bar on your power usage graph . We 've found that American users , on average , have 589 watts of electrical power being consumed all day long . What items are using all this electricity ? <p> - " Vampire loads " - appliances that do n't really turn off , even when you 're not actively using them <p> - Old appliances , especially refrigerators <p> - Lights that are never turned off <p> - Outdoor lights <p> - Cable box or DVR <p> - Computers that never turn off <p> - Electric water heaters <p> Here 's the good news : It 's typically very easy to reduce your Always On power . Below is a graph of a household that did just that . This household started reducing electricity use by turning off their outdoor lighting ( green period ) instead of leaving the lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced the average Always On from 420 watts to 300 watts . That 120 watt Always On reduction can yield hundreds of dollars in estimated savings over a single year ! <p> On January 27 , 2010 , almost 40% of Google PowerMeter users had Always On levels at over 500 watts . If these users reduced that amount by just 100 watts each , that 's a significant cumulative savings . ( Look for more of these aggregate analyses of our data in the future as we continue to learn more about how people use electricity. )
