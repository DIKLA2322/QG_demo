@@13268990 @1868990/ <h> Tuesday 11/11/2008 01:14:00 PM <p> Like many Googlers , we 're fascinated by trends in online search queries . Whether you 're interested in U.S. elections , today 's hot trends , or each year 's Zeitgeist , patterns in Google search queries can be very informative . Last year , a small team of software engineers began to explore if we could go beyond simple trends and accurately model real-world phenomena using patterns in search queries . After meeting with the public health gurus on Google.org 's Predict and Prevent team , we decided to focus on outbreaks of infectious disease , which are responsible for millions of deaths around the world each year . You 've probably heard of one such disease : influenza , commonly known as " the flu , " which is responsible for up to 500,000 deaths worldwide each year . If you or your kids have ever caught the flu , you know just how awful it can be . <p> Our team found that certain aggregated search queries tend to be very common during flu season each year . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , and we found that there 's a very close relationship between the frequency of these search queries and the number of people who are experiencing flu-like symptoms each week . As a result , if we tally each day 's flu-related search queries , we can estimate how many people have a flu-like illness . Based on this discovery , we have launched Google Flu Trends , where you can find up-to-date influenza-related activity estimates for each of the 50 states in the U.S. <p> The CDC does a great job of surveying real doctors and patients to accurately track the flu , so why bother with estimates from aggregated search queries ? It turns out that traditional flu surveillance systems take 1-2 weeks to collect and release surveillance data , but Google search queries can be automatically counted very quickly . By making our flu estimates available each day , Google Flu Trends may provide an early-warning system for outbreaks of influenza . <p> For epidemiologists , this is an exciting development , because early detection of a disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new strain of influenza virus emerges under certain conditions , a pandemic could emerge and cause millions of deaths ( as happened , for example , in 1918 ) . Our up-to-date influenza estimates may enable public health officials and health professionals to better respond to seasonal epidemics and though we hope never to find out pandemics . <p> We shared our preliminary results with the Epidemiology and Prevention Branch of the Influenza Division at CDC throughout the 2007-2008 flu season , and together we saw that our search-based flu estimates had a consistently strong correlation with real CDC surveillance data . Our system is still very experimental , so anything is possible , but we 're hoping to see similar correlations in the coming year . <p> We could n't have created such good models without aggregating hundreds of billions of individual searches going back to 2003 . Of course , we 're keenly aware of the trust that users place in us and of our responsibility to protect their privacy . Flu Trends can never be used to identify individual users because we rely on anonymized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . The patterns we observe in the data are only meaningful across large populations of Google search users . <p> Flu season is here , so avoid becoming part of our statistics and get a flu shot ! And keep an eye on those graphs if you 're curious to see how the flu season unfolds ... <p> Update on 11/21 : The team just published an academic paper in Nature , the international journal of science , explaining the science and methodology behind Flu Trends . Check it out for more information .
