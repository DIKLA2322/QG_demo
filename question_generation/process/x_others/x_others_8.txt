And unfortunately , many nonprofits designed to offer set types of goods and services are n't able to meet the unique needs of individual recipients . <p> GiveDirectly has very a different idea : that the most effective way to have a long-term impact on poverty is to give people a basic starter income with no strings attached . Funds are delivered via simple mobile transfers . Recipients can then invest the money in whatever is most pressing - whether that be planting crops , replacing a roof or sending their kids to a better school . No matter the decision , GiveDirectly meticulously tracks each donation in order to ensure that the aid is being spent effectively . <p> All this data collection has also produced a larger revelation .

The grant helped the organization scale direct cash transfers to more Kenyan families and duplicate its program in Uganda . Two years later , a second round of funding enabled GiveDirectly to expand to additional countries in East Africa as well as conduct a study in Western Kenya that examined the macroeconomic , communal , social , and psychological impact of their cash transfers .

This level of transparency is unprecedented , and gives citizens across the country a rare look into how their criminal justice system is working -- down to the county level . @qwx162836 <p> Google.org has given MFJ $1.5 million to expand its work throughout the country , with an initial focus on California . Googler volunteers are also advising on large scale data processing strategies for MFJ 's growing database .
