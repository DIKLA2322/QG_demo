As part of the Google.org Geo Challenge Grants Program , Rocky Mountain Institute ( RMI ) has created a map of US oil imports by country since 1973 . By clicking on the green light to play , you can see the countries supplying oil to the U.S. ( either in terms of barrels or dollar value ) and how our imports have changed over the last 35 years.The thicker the line in the map , the more oil produced or imported . While this map highlights data on United States oil imports , the picture is similar for every oil-importing country in the world . <p> The map highlights 5 eras of oil consumption , from the oil shocks of the 1970s to the price collapse in the 1980s to recent events including Hurricane Katrina and gas approaching $5 per gallon before retreating rapidly recently . ( You can see these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the RMI website . ) One interesting time period is from 1982 to 1985 , when low prices caused oil imports from the Middle East to decline to very low levels . <p> The map also looks at potential oil from offshore drilling and exploration of the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge ( ANWR ) . The screenshot below illustrates the impact of off-shore drilling . With the map zoomed or drilled 3-5 levels down and centered near Alabama ( and the map pushpin that represents offshore ) , check out the very thin line that shows the potential peak production of 220,000 barrels per day.The lines represent estimates of production in 20-30 years , and even with this very long timeline , the amount of oil that could be generated from offshore drilling is miniscule compared to our oil needs today . <p> Both Google and RMI are working hard to help create a future where we are not reliant on daily imports of millions of barrels of oil that pollute our atmosphere and risk our national security . <p> Today , along with the Brookings Institution , RMI is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identify solutions to break Americas dependence on oil , with Google in attendance . In 2004 , RMIs Chief Scientist , Chairman and Co-founder Amory Lovins and a team of RMI collaborators drafted Winning the Oil Endgame ( PDF of the book ) - a roadmap for the United States to get completely off oil by 2050 . <p> Google.orgs RechargeIT initiative is driving toward the commercialization of plug-in vehicles that can wean the US off gasoline . In our Clean Energy 2030 Plan we show that increasing conventional automobile mileage , deploying millions of plug-in hybrids and accelerating the turnover of the fleet would reduce oil consumption by 51% by 2030 . That decrease would have an even larger effect on oil imports because we produce about one-third of our oil in the US . Google and RMI have worked together on a number of projects including RMIs Smart GarageCharrette , a summit to identify the barriers and breakthroughs needed to electrify the U.S. auto fleet . <p> While oil prices have declined rapidly over the past five months , most people expect oil prices to remain high into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop in oil prices reduces the need to act , President-Elect Barack Obama responded that we go from " shock to trance " and as a result " never make any progress .
