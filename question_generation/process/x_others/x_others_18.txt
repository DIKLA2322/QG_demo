We recently published new satellite imagery over the affected area to show an aerial view of the impact . To view this high-resolution imagery , courtesy of our partners at GeoEye , download this KML and explore it in Google Earth . You can also have a look at this Picasa album of before and after shots . here 's an example of what you 'll see : <p> Before and after shots of the central business district . The north-south street is Manchester Street . <p> As a response to this recent catastrophic event , our Crisis Response team also worked quickly to get important information , relevant news and helpful resources to those affected by the disaster and those following developments in New Zealand . We released Person Finder three hours after the earthquake to help people connect with their loved ones . We hope this new updated satellite imagery is valuable for aid workers and the public for illustrating the extent of the damage .

@@13268921 @1868921/ <h> Tuesday 2/15/2011 08:00:00 AM <p> In an effort to foster a more open , transparent and accessible scientific dialogue , we 've started a new effort aimed at inspiring pioneering use of technology , new media and computational thinking in the communication of science to diverse audiences . Initially , well focus on communicating the science on climate change . <p> Were kicking off this effort by naming 21 Google Science Communication Fellows . These fellows were elected from a pool of applicants of early to mid-career Ph.D . scientists nominated by leaders in climate change research and science-based institutions across the U.S. It was hard to choose just 21 fellows from such an impressive pool of scientists ; ultimately , we chose scientists who had the strongest potential to become excellent communicators . That meant previous training in science communication ; research in topics related to understanding or managing climate change ; and experience experimenting with innovative approaches or technology tools for science communication . This years fellows are an impressive bunch : <p> Brendan Bohannan , Associate Professor of Environmental Studies and Biology , University of Oregon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oregon State University <p> Julia Cole , Professor , Department of Geosciences , University of Arizona <p> Whendee Silver , Professor , Ecosystem Ecology and Biogeochemistry , University of California-Berkeley <p> Alan Townsend , Professor , Ecology and Evolutionary Biology , University of Colorado <p> At our Mountain View , Calif. headquarters in June , the fellows will participate in a workshop , which will integrate hands-on training and facilitated brainstorming on topics of technology and science communication . Following the workshop , fellows will be given the opportunity to apply for grants to put their ideas into practice . Those with the most impactful projects will be given the opportunity to join a Lindblad Expeditions &amp; National Geographic trip to the Arctic , the Galapagos or Antarctica as a science communicator . <p> Congratulations to all of the fellows ! And well keep you posted on more ideas and tools emerging for science communication .
