By leveraging the high quality , up-to-date information provided by users in Google Map Maker , UNITAR is able to produce and distribute helpful composite map products using tools such as UNITARS Operational Satellite Applications Programme ( UNOSAT ) . These products played a key role in facilitating modern humanitarian relief for the recent disaster in Pakistan . <p> Dr. Carlos Lopes , United Nations Assistant Secretary-General and Executive Director of UNITAR , expressed his excitement both to work with Google and that UNITAR/UNOSAT resources that had previously been spent on mapping data collection could now be invested directly into analysis . He remarked that users and beneficiaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international NGOs and national entities from government and civil societies , and of course , the people directly affected by disasters and other crises . <p> We hope that the interest and increased awareness that the Shanghai World Expo event generated about Google Map Maker helps to build an even stronger user community . Its the online mapping contributions of volunteers across the globe that enable Map Maker to be a valuable tool for humanitarian activities like this as well as a source of quality maps in the developing world . Let 's continue mapping the world together !
