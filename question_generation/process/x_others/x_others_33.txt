Where and when will it strike ? How severe will it be ? What resources are available to help ? <p> The Google Crisis Response team works on providing critical emergency information during crises . Our goal is to surface emergency information through the online tools you use everyday , when that information is relevant and useful . <p> If you click through to " more info " on this alert , you 'll find a page showing more details about the alert , with the full description from the alert publisher , in this case the National Weather Service , a link to their site and other useful information . <p> Whether you see an alert depends on which alerts are active at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ query . If you 're interested in seeing all of the active alerts in one place , visit our homepage at **27;377;TOOLONG . This page also provides a link to more information on our new platform and gives instructions to interested organizations who want to make their emergency data available through this tool . <p> Were learning as we go and were working hard to continuously improve the range and relevance of the content you see , so wed really like your feedback .

Once approved , those additions are then reflected on Google Maps and Google Earth for others around the world to see . <p> The Google Map Maker data includes detailed maps of more than 150 countries and regions , and identifies locations like schools , hospitals , roads , settlements and water points that are critical for relief workers to know about in times of crisis . The data will also be useful for planning purposes , as governments and their development partners can use the information to monitor public services , infrastructure and development projects ; make them more transparent for NGOs , researchers , and individual citizens ; and more effectively identify areas that might be in need of assistance before a disaster strikes . <p> Community mapper in Kampala , Uganda <p> World Bank partner organizations , which include government and United Nations agencies , will be able to contact World Bank offices for possible access to the Google @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country offices in Kenya , South Sudan , Tanzania , Sierra Leone , Ghana , Zambia , Nigeria , Democratic Republic of Congo , Moldova , Mozambique , Nepal , and Haiti plan to pilot the Map Maker agreement . <p> Google has enjoyed a strong relationship with World Bank for many years .

Earlier today FCC energy and environment director Nick Sinai gave a sneak preview of one of the Plan 's key components : how broadband will facilitate smarter energy usage . <p> He told an audience at the Clean-tech Investor Summit that the FCC will call on States and the Congress to give consumers and consumer-authorized third parties access to real-time energy information . This kind of information could have a huge financial and environmental impact . Studies show that access to real-time usage data results in energy savings of up to 15% . He talked about how , combined with other measures , this information could create a platform that could lead to new products and services to help consumers manage energy . Picture it : a smart phone apps store for home energy management . <p> Sinai singled out for praise technologies like " smart " electricity meters and recent efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a statewide smart meter roll out . ( Learn more by reading Google 's comments . ) While encouraged by state-led initiatives like this , Sinai said if state efforts do n't work , the FCC could recommend that Congress consider national energy data accessibility legislation . <h> Friday 1/15/2010 07:41:00 PM <p> With relief efforts underway , many displaced Haitians and their friends and families around the world are deeply concerned about the safety and whereabouts of loved ones . In response to the Haitian earthquake , a team of Googlers worked with the U.S. Department of State to create an online People Finder gadget so that people can submit information about missing persons and to search the database . <p> You 'll find this gadget on our Haiti earthquake response website as well as on the State Department website . In order to prevent the proliferation of multiple missing persons databases ( a big problem during Hurricane Katrina ) , we 've made the People Finder gadget standards-based and easily embeddable on any website ( see here for instructions ) . The gadget is currently available in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping families in the U.S. stay connected with their loved ones in Haiti by offering free calls to Haiti for the next two weeks via Google Voice .

Now you can view the imagery without downloading the KML file and can use the time slider to easily compare the stark before-and-after images , such as those below . To help relief organizations , GeoEye has made professional-quality files of their recent satellite imagery of Haiti downloadable via our earthquake response website . We hope the imagery in this format will be valuable to GIS organizations and aid workers . <p> ( Click to see full-size ) <p> We have also made Haiti Map Maker data publicly available for download for non-commercial use and attribution . Data can be used by relief workers to do things such as create offline maps , combine data sets and run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their efforts on the ground . Please help improve Haiti maps with Google Map Maker . <p> News and user footage continues to roll into YouTube .

Since the strain of influenza that is active ( H1N1 ) is novel , no one knows exactly what will happen next . However , the CDC is warning that one possibility is a second spike of flu activity , which is what occured in 1957 when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> We 've been chatting with public health officials about new ways we can help people understand the spread of flu during this unusual time and today we 're excited to bring city level flu estimates to 121 cities in the United States . <p> By tracking the popularity of certain Google search queries , we 're able to estimate the level of flu in near real-time . Google Flu Trends is updated daily and may provide early detection of flu activity , since traditional flu surveillance systems often take days or weeks to collect and release data . These city level estimates are " experimental , " meaning they have n't been validated against official data . However , the estimates are made in a similar manner to our U.S. national estimates , which have been validated . Check out our YouTube video for a quick introduction to this system .

They started by aggregating thousands of new Bottom Hole Temperature ( BHT ) readings from oil , gas , and water wells in previously under-sampled regions of the U.S. For example , The 2004 Geothermal Map of North America used only 5 heat flow points informing geothermal estimates for West Virginia , compared to the additional 1,455 BHT points in the updated version .
