We talked about our vision to use strengths of Google in information and technology to build products and advocate for critical policies that address global challenges . Ideas for projects continue to pour in from Googlers and partners around the globe , and we 're incubating several new projects in the areas of economic development , clean energy and access to technology . <p> Introduced Earth Engine , a new computational platform we have begun building for global-scale analysis of satellite imagery to monitor changes in key environmental indicators like forest coverage , at COP15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chile , with maps , updated earth imagery , and networking projects , and built Person Finder to help people find information about their loved ones after a disaster . <p> Advocated for policies to spur innovation of renewable energy technologies that are cheaper than coal ( RE&lt;C ) , and our engineers worked on ways to reduce the cost of solar thermal and other RE&lt;C technologies . <p> We will continue to greenlight large scale engineering projects that build on Google 's strengths in technology , our computing infrastructure and global teams . <p> Overall , our philanthropic mission at Google includes our Google.org projects and a range of other initiatives - from grants , scholarships and other charitable giving programs to in-kind product support for non-profits . Our founders have set a goal of devoting approximately 1% of Google 's equity and yearly profits to philanthropy . In 2009 , we devoted around $100 million plus in-kind giving to a broad range of philanthropic efforts . Here are some highlights : <p> Academic scholarships and awards : We provide scholarships to encourage students of various backgrounds , ethnicities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these and other programs will help dismantle barriers that keep women and minorities from entering computing and technology fields . <p> Academic grants : We support the next generation of engineers and maintain strong ties with academic institutions worldwide that are pursuing research in core areas relevant to our mission . We fund projects across a variety of subjects , host visiting faculty members at Google , and have launched the Google Fellowship Program to fund graduate students doing innovative research in several fields . <p> Holiday charitable gift : We made $22 million in donations in 2009 to a couple of dozen deserving charities around the world to help organizations that have been stretched thin by more requests for help in a year of fewer donations . <p> Employee gift matching : Google matches up to $6,000 for each employee 's annual charitable contributions and contributes $50 for every five hours an employee volunteers through our " Dollars for Doers " program to encourage employee participation in charitable causes . <p> Charitable Giving Council : We support grants for Googler-led partnerships on causes such as K-12 educational initiatives in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We invest in communities where Google has a presence around the world , creating opportunities for Googlers to invest time and expertise , engage in local grant making and build partnerships with local stakeholders . <p> In addition , our Google for Non-Profits site provides information and links to free tools to help charitable groups promote their cause , raise money , collaborate with others and operate more efficiently . Google Grants , for example , offers in-kind AdWords advertising to non-profit organizations . Since the program began , we 've donated over $625 million worth of AdWords advertising to all kinds of charitable organizations .
