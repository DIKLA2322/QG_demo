Visit http : **34;661;TOOLONG for more information and to access the data . If you have familiarity with the region , please help these efforts by contributing data about Chile on Google Map Maker . We will be refreshing the download data frequently to reflect the latest set of contributions . <p> For those concerned about loved ones in Chile , the Person Finder tool , initially created in the wake of the Haiti earthquake , can be used to submit or search for information about individuals who may have been affected . The Person Finder tool has been translated into Spanish and is currently available at http : **32;697;TOOLONG , as well as several media sites and the US Department of State website .

GHC sent their inaugural class of 22 recent university graduates to complete year-long assignments in public health organizations in various countries . This program came to fruition after discussions at the aids2031 conference hosted by Google.org in March 2008 . <p> GHC is a unique program that enhances a fellow 's cultural experience by pairing cross cultural teams - one fellow from the host country and one international fellow . Once accepted , all chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University . This year GHC has 32 open positions with locations ranging from Burundi , Rwanda , New Jersey , Malawi , and Massachusetts . We believe that Global Health Corps offers a unique experience that enables young professionals to gain valuable experience for strengthening global public health equity . <p> The American application deadline is set for March 1st while the deadline for in-country fellows is April 1st . Applicants must be under 30 years old , possess at least an undergraduate degree , and be proficient in English .

Good luck ! <h> Tuesday 2/02/2010 02:10:00 PM <p> " Always On " power is the lowest level of sustained power used during a day-long period .

Below is a graph of a household that did just that . This household started reducing electricity use by turning off their outdoor lighting ( green period ) instead of leaving the lights on all day ( red period ) . That change reduced the average Always On from 420 watts to 300 watts . That 120 watt Always On reduction can yield hundreds of dollars in estimated savings over a single year ! <p> On January 27 , 2010 , almost 40% of Google PowerMeter users had Always On levels at over 500 watts . If these users reduced that amount by just 100 watts each , that 's a significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyses of our data in the future as we continue to learn more about how people use electricity. )
