@@13269019 @1869019/ <h> Friday 8/13/2010 09:33:00 AM <p> Pakistan has been struck by the worst flooding in its recorded history . The latest estimate of the number of people affected by the flood exceeds 14 millionmore than the combined total of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami , the 2005 Kashmir earthquake and the 2010 Haiti earthquake . Critical infrastructure has been damaged over the last two weeks and clean water is in short supply . As monsoons approach , flooding is expected to worsen . <p> Our Crisis Response team has been working to use existing tools and build new ones to help the relief efforts . We just launched a page in Urdu and English where you can find information , resources and donation opportunities to help the victims of the floods . Were also donating $250,000 to international and local NGOs to immediately aid in relief efforts . Although we 've been able to provide satellite imagery for disasters in the past , cloud cover in Pakistan has prevented us from compiling useful imagery so far . We hope to share imagery as soon as possible . <p> We 've already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts to help with disaster relief . Following the earthquake in Haiti , a small team of Googlers visited relief aid workers in Haiti to understand how we could further help . In observing and speaking with the relief aid workers , we learned that they needed up-to-date information about available resources ( such as which field hospitals have X-ray machines or orthopedic surgeons ) , their location and contact information . Coordination between various health and relief facilities that spring up in a disaster zone can be challenging . <p> Based on what we learned in Haiti , we 've been working to develop Resource Finder , a new tool to help disseminate updated information about which services various health facilities offer . It provides a map with editable records to help relief workers maintain up-to-date information on the services , doctors , equipment and beds available at neighboring health facilities so that they can efficiently arrange patient transfers . We normally would n't release the tool so quickly , but decided to make an early release version of Resource Finder available for supporting relief efforts in Pakistan . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disaster situation so well be working closely with NGOs to understand its usefulness and will iterate accordingly . <p> We 've also launched Person Finder in both Urdu and English for this disaster . This application allows individuals to check and post on the status of relatives or friends affected by a disaster . Fortunately , we 've heard that missing persons has not been as concerning an issue as it was during the earthquakes in Haiti and Chile , but well leave the application up regardless . <p> Responding to a disaster of this scale is a daunting task , but we can all do something to help . We will try to do our part and continue working with the many incredible NGOs to develop tools that help them work more effectively .
