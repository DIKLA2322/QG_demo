Given heightened attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an urgency to engage with new , disruptive startups. " - Aneesh Chopra , Former CTO , US Government <p> Code for America ( CfA ) is a non-profit that 's trying to make the connection between start-ups and government . Two years ago , CfA launched with a fellowship program to pair passionate technologists with innovative city governments to build new solutions to civic problems -- they call it a peace corps for geeks . <p> Last year , Google.org made a grant to Code for America to expand and scale their work . In particular , Code for America was looking to complement its work inside government with energy from the outside , from companies looking to provide new services and experiences to citizens . They wanted to support " civic startups , " startups that not only made a profit but also made a better government . <p> Out of that support came Code for Americas idea for a first-of-its-kind civic startup accelerator , which is now taking apllications : **30;438;TOOLONG <p> What 's a civic startup ? Consider SeeClickFix , which allows citizens to report neighborhood issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using open government data , or GovLoop , which connects government employees to collaborate and share knowledge . Code for America is looking to build upon these examples to create a new ecosystem of civic startups . <p> The CfA Accelerator will " turbo-charge " select civic startups by providing them a springboard to amplify market awareness of their product , additional funding ( a $25K seed grant ) , business mentoring specific to the Gov 2.0 space , and introductions to a broad network of civic leaders and potential investors . <p> Code for America is recruiting teams in three key target areas : 1 ) providing services on top of open government data 2 ) bringing modern web technologies directly to governments ; 3 ) changing the way citizens ask , get , or need services from government . <p> The program is being led by entrepreneur Ron Bouganim with the support of advisors , Caterina Fake ( co-founder of Flickr and Pinwheel ) , Peter Schwartz ( founder of the Global Business Network ) , Ron Conway , ( partner at SV Angel ) , and Aneesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The first class will kick off this August , and the deadline for applications is June 1 .
