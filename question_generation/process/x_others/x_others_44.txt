@@13269028 @1869028/ <h> Friday 11/20/2009 01:02:00 PM <p> There are still power plants operating today that Thomas Edison could have seen with his own eyes . If he were to tour our electrical grid , he would recognize that too . As former Secretary of State George Shultz says , in energy " the past must not be prologue . " Can we reinvent our energy system in only ten years ? I think we can -- but we need to have a clear mission , we need to aim high , and we need substantial and sustained R&amp;D funding . <p> This funding , coupled with tax incentives , loan guarantees , and other market mechanisms , is needed to drive innovation across the entire R&amp;D pipeline -- from research , to development , to demonstration , to deployment , to full-scale commercialization . At Google we like to say , " from lightbulbs to lightbulbs " -- from the initial idea to real products . However you phrase it , investment is needed across that entire pipeline , especially from the government in the early stages where the energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generate technological breakthroughs . <p> Since 1980 U.S. federal investment in energy R&amp;D has dropped by 58 percent . Back then , 10 percent of the total government R&amp;D investment was in energy . Today , the percentage has shrunk to only two percent . Recent signs in Washington are definitely positive . Earlier this year , President Obama added over $5.7 billion in 2-year stimulus funding for energy research , development , and demonstration . But this is n't enough , and it 's not sustained . We 're still on a 2-lane innovation road , not a superhighway -- and the road we 're currently on is headed for a big cliff . Unless something changes , we 're going to lose this significant funding after next year . <p> President Obama has called for $150 billion over 10 years for energy R&amp;D . Some experts go even further -- Professors Dan Kammen and Gregory Nemet at UC Berkeley propose that annual energy R&amp;D levels on the order of $30 billion will be necessary to address the climate challenge . And I was delighted to see recently that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund breakthrough ideas -- has made its first set of grants of $151 million for 37 projects . This is a great start , but it is only a start . We all need do our part to help convince our leaders in Washington to follow up on this down payment with substantial and sustained investment . <h> Tuesday 11/10/2009 09:46:00 AM <p> This year , it 's especially important to have clear information on what you can do to prepare for the flu season . With this in mind , we are happy to share a new feature for the U.S. which allows you to more easily find locations near you for getting both the seasonal and H1N1 flu vaccine . After expandingGoogle Flu Trends to a total of 20 countries and 38 languages , allowing more people to see near real-time estimates of flu activity , we began brainstorming with the U.S. Department for Health and Human Services ( HHS ) , their flu.gov collaborators and the American Lung Association on the flu shot finder and other ways Google can be helpful to people this flu season . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ www.google.com/flushot . The same tool will also be available shortly on www.flu.gov and the American Lung Association websites . It 's important to note that this project is just beginning and we have not yet received information about flu shot clinics for many locations . In addition , many locations that are shown are currently out of stock . We launched this service now in order to help disseminate information about locations where vaccines are available , and also to make more vaccine providers aware of the project so that they can contribute . <p> Especially given slower than expected vaccine production , we think it 's important to bring together flu shot information in a coherent manner . We 've been working with HHS , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) and state and local health agencies to gather information on flu vaccine locations across the country , particularly for the H1N1 flu vaccine ( both the nasal-spray vaccine and the shot ) . At the moment we have data for locations of flu vaccine directly from 20 states and counting . We are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all 50 states ; today , you 'll find results from chains such as Walgreens , CVS and PDX participants , such as Kmart , Duane Reade , WinnDixie and Giant Eagle . <p> Of course you should still call flu vaccine providers ahead of time to find out more about availability and eligibility for the two vaccines . <p> We hope to continue providing you with relevant information to help keep you and your loved ones healthy .
@@13269029 @1869029/ <h> Monday 2/23/2009 04:17:00 PM <p> When Larry and Sergey laid out their vision for Google.org , they hoped that this " experiment in active philanthropy " would one day have an even greater impact on the world than Google itself . They committed resources from Google 's profits , equity and substantial employee time to this philanthropic effort , and they created the mission : " to use the power of information and technology to address the global challenges of our age . " They structured Google.org so that in addition to traditional grant making , it can also invest in for-profit companies , advocate for policies and , most important , tap into Google 's strengths : its employees , products and technologies . At first I was skeptical about " going corporate , " but I came on board convinced that Google could make real progress on these issues . I think we have made an excellent beginning , but it is just a very few steps on a long path . <p> Now , three years after Google.org was founded , we 've been reviewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's clear that I am most effective in helping to identify " big ideas " and potential partners , as well as raising awareness about society 's biggest challenges . I am therefore very excited to become Google 's Chief Philanthropy Evangelist . I think this is the highest contribution that I can make both to Google.org and to fighting the urgent threats of our day : from climate change to emerging infectious diseases , to issues of poverty and health care . By focusing my energy outwards I hope to be able to spend more time motivating policy makers , encouraging public and private partnerships , and generally advocating for the changes that we must make as a global society to solve these problems . Long-time Googler Megan Smith will take over day-to-day management of Google.org , joining as General Manager to lead us through this transition , in addition to her existing role as Vice President of New Business Development . <p> One of the first things that Megan will focus on is how Google.org can best achieve its mission . During our review it became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkable non-profit organizations over the past three years , our greatest impact has come when we 've attacked problems in ways that make the most of Google 's strengths in technology and information ; examples of this approach include Flu Trends , RechargeIT , Clean Energy 2030 , and PowerMeter . By aligning Google.org more closely with Google as a whole , Megan will ensure that we 're better able to build innovative , scalable technology and information solutions . As a first step , Google has decided to put even more engineers and technical talent to work on these issues and problems , resources which I have found to be extraordinary . In this global economic crisis , the work Google.org is doing , together with our many colleagues around the world , to help develop cheap clean energy , find and fight disease outbreaks before they sweep the globe , and build information platforms for underserved people globally , is more important than ever . We stand behind the commitment made in 2004 to devote 1% of Google 's equity and profits to philanthropy , and we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our resources have the greatest possible impact for good . <h> Wednesday 2/18/2009 11:24:00 PM <p> Just one week after launching Google 's energy information campaign , we kicked off our first joint smart grid event with GE , a larger clean energy collaboration we announced last fall . Our timing was fortuitous ; the event took place just as President Obama signed an historic economic stimulus bill that includes $11 billion to modernize the electricity grid . <p> Getting energy information into the hands of consumers requires reworking the electricity grid to make it smarter . At yesterday 's event , hosted in Google 's Washington office , experts explored what the fundamental elements of a smarter grid should be -- from empowering consumers with information , tools , and choices to manage their energy use , to creating an open system that encourages innovation , to enabling a massive scale up of renewable energy sources and plug-in vehicles . We also explored the government 's role in accelerating these efforts . Our panelists were enthusiastic about the opportunity created by the stimulus , but also noted the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an effective and efficient manner . <p> Historically such funding has been anemic . After a peak in 1978 of $7 billion , U.S. government funding for energy RD&amp;D dropped by more than 70% . Corporate RD&amp;D fell even more , and funding in the early 2000s totaled just 0.3% of sector revenue , compared to 15% in the biotech sector . Is it any wonder the energy sector has struggled to make progress ? <p> What level of energy RD&amp;D funding is needed ? Kammen and Nemet look at several different metrics and suggest that a sustained level between $20-40 billion is needed to reinvigorate the field . Recent activities push in the right direction : 2008 funding reached $3 billion , 50% higher than during the early 2000s , and the stimulus bill recently signed into law adds $3.25 billion in new RD&amp;D funding for clean energy . But to have a truly transformative effect , investment needs to climb even higher . <p> In addition , without emphasizing the " R " in RD&amp;D , we will produce only incremental improvements . We need to prime the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce radically better ( and cheaper ) technologies . This will provide long-term job growth , and also increase consumers ' buying power , stimulating the economy . <p> Funding must also be coupled with long-term demand for clean technology . This gives companies confidence their investments will pay out , and assures students entering the field that jobs wo n't evaporate . Research must also focus more on clean tech ; in recent years only 40% of energy RD&amp;D funding has gone to renewable energy and energy efficiency . <p> At Google we 've learned some that might be successfully applied to energy : <p> " Put the user first and all else follows . " For instance , customers care about saving money , but only if it 's easy to measure . Providing ways to cheaply monitor energy consumption is a powerful first step . <p> " Great just is n't good enough . " Cost-parity for renewables is required for long-term competitiveness , but to replace conventional technology we must develop renewable electricity cheaper than coal , the least expensive fossil fuel . <p> " Launch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , get new technologies into the marketplace quickly , then improve through iteration . <p> These strategies will make sure that the widest possible set of ideas are considered , increasing the number of breakthroughs . A " fail fast " policy would allocate people to the great ideas , with high-impact results guaranteeing continued funding , particularly at the critical demonstration stage where many technologies fail to attract sufficient capital . Carrying projects over this " Valley of Death " to full commercialization will ultimately result in the best , lowest-cost technologies rapidly reaching the market . For the sake of the planet , clean energy ca n't arrive soon enough . <h> Thursday 2/12/2009 01:06:00 PM <p> A guest post from Howard White , Executive Director , International Initiative for Impact Evaluation : <p> In the foreign aid business , it 's very important to answer the question , " Was this a successful project ? " because donors need to know where to target their scarce resources . Unfortunately , the answer to this question has frequently been , " Well it must be , we spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This problem has been most recently highlighted by the Centre for Global Developments report , " When Will We Ever Learn ? " . Billions of dollars are spent on development interventions each year with little evidence on whether they work or not . <p> I started my own academic career looking at aid impact at the macroeconomic level . In my own defense , I can say that , starting with my PhD , I criticized the over-aggregated cross-country regression approach , arguing instead for careful country-level analysis of macro impact that could pick up on both context but also the many channels both money and ideas through which aid affects development outcomes . Having published a couple of widely ignored books pursuing this approach , I became increasingly convinced that aid impact had to be examined from the bottom up . That is a systematic analysis of , if not all interventions , then enough to be able to make authoritative statements about whether the aid program is working or not . This might seem like a lot of work ; but then so is measuring GDP and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to implementing a bottom up approach . The first is that evaluation design is often poor when it comes to measuring impact . The second problem is that most agencies do not systematically compile evidence across interventions . It is symptomatic of a culture of producing evaluations as a bureaucratic requirement , not as a management or learning tool . <p> It is to tackle these two problems - the lack of evidence and the failure to synthesize what evidence there is into policy-relevant lessons that the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation ( 3ie ) has been created . Google.org has been one of our early funders . <p> The bulk of 3ie funding is going to help expand our knowledge about what works by supporting new impact studies , focusing on what we call the enduring questions of development . We are in the process of a consultative exercise to identify these questions to which you can contribute by visiting our website . We will also have an open window for studies on other topics , for which the first request for proposals went out recently . Please visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2/09/2009 09:07:00 PM <p> Imagine how hard it would be to stick to a budget in a store with no prices . Well , that 's pretty much how we buy electricity today . Your utility company sends you a bill at the end of the month with very few details . Most people do n't know how much electricity their appliances use , where in the house they are wasting electricity , or how much the bill might go up during different seasons . But in a world where everyone had a detailed understanding of their home energy use , we could find all sorts of ways to save energy and lower electricity bills . In fact , studies show that access to home energy information results in savings between 5-15% on monthly electricity bills . It may not sound like much , but if half of America 's households cut their energy demand by 10 percent , it would be the equivalent of taking eight million cars off the road . <p> Googles mission is to " organize the worlds information and make it universally accessible and useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detailed information about their home electricity use . We 're tackling the challenge on several fronts , from policy advocacy to developing consumer tools , and even investing in smart grid companies . We 've been participating in the dialogue in Washington , DC and with public agencies in the U.S. and other parts of the world to advocate for investment in the building of a " smart grid , " to bring our 1950s-era electricity grid into the digital age . Specifically , to provide both consumers and utilities with real-time energy information , homes must be equipped with advanced energy meters called " smart meters . " There are currently about 40 million smart meters in use worldwide , with plans to add another 100 million in the next few years . <p> But deploying smart meters alone is n't enough . This needs to be coupled with a strategy to provide customers with easy access to energy information . That 's why we believe that open protocols and standards should serve as the cornerstone of smart grid projects , to spur innovation , drive competition , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We believe that detailed data on your personal energy use belongs to you , and should be available in an open standard , non-proprietary format . You should control who gets to see your data , and you should be free to choose from a wide range of services to help you understand it and benefit from it . For more details on our policy suggestions , check out the comments we filed yesterday with the California Public Utility Commission . <p> In addition to policy advocacy , we 're building consumer tools , too . Over the last several months , our engineers have developed a software tool called Google PowerMeter , which will show consumers their home energy information almost in real time , right on their computer . Google PowerMeter is not yet available to the public since we 're testing it out with Googlers first . But we 're building partnerships with utilities and independent device manufacturers to gradually roll this out in pilot programs . Once we 've had a chance to kick the tires , we 'll make the tool more widely available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with detailed energy information . And it will take the combined efforts of federal and state governments , utilities , device manufacturers , and software engineers to empower consumers to use electricity more wisely by giving them access to energy information .

It will build on a current U.S. National Academies study , which is assessing the technology risks and tradeoffs for various energy technologies . An understanding of the geographic , technical , and economic constraints will help guide Chinese decision makers to develop appropriate strategies to sustainably meet their energy needs . Chinas manufacturing prowess , combined with its growing domestic market , provide opportunities to accelerate progress and reduce costs for renewable energy technologies . <p> The U.S. and China represent the world 's two largest consumers of energy .

This year 's issue up for discussion is poverty , so we wanted to take a look at the relationship between access to information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right time in the hands of people has enormous power . As someone who works for Google , I see evidence of this everyday as people search and find information they need to create knowledge , grow their business , or access essential services . But that applies primarily to the rich world , where economies are built on knowledge and presume access to information . What about the poor and developing countries where people are offline more than online ? How do they benefit from the power of information ? <p> In much of Sub-Saharan Africa , for example , rates of economic growth over the last decade have exceeded 5% every year . Despite this trend , poverty in many countries has remained constant . In Kenya , for example , the official poverty rate was 48% in 1981 . According to the Kenya Poverty and Inequality Assessment released by the World Bank this year , 17 million Kenyans or 47% of the population were unable to meet the costs of food sufficient to fulfill basic daily caloric requirements . The vast majority of these people live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information that impacts their daily life . Data on water quality , education and health budgets , and agricultural prices are nearly impossible to access . <p> Despite hundreds of millions of dollars spent each year on providing basic public services like primary education , health , water , and sanitation to poor communities , poverty in much of Sub-Saharan Africa persists . Where does this money go , who gets it , and what are the results of the resources invested ? That 's where we find a big black hole of information and a lack of basic accountability . How do inputs ( dollars spent ) turn into outputs ( schools , clinics , and wells ) , and , more importantly , how do outputs translate into results ( literate and healthy children , clean water , etc . ) ? <p> We simply do n't  know the answers to most of these basic questions . But what if we could ? What if a mother could find out how much money was budgeted for her daughter 's school each year and how much of it was received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often teachers are absent from school or whether health clinics have the medicines they are supposed to carry ? What if citizens could access and report on basic information to determine value for money as tax payers ? <p> The work of SODNET in Kenya is illustrative . They are developing a simple budget-tracking tool that allows citizens to track the allocation , use , and ultimate result of government funds earmarked for infrastructure projects in their districts . The tool is intended to create transparency in the use of tax revenues and answer the simple question : Are resources reaching their intended beneficiaries ? Using tools like maps , they are able to overlay information that begins to tell a compelling story . <p> Google.orgs role , through our partners in East Africa and India , is to support , catalyze , and widely disseminate this kind of information to public , private , and civil society stakeholders that can use it to see more clearly what 's working , what 's broken and what are potential solutions . Leveraging platforms like Google Earth and Google Maps can help organizations disseminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was once invisible . Once information is visible , widely known , and easy to understand , we are betting that governments and citizens will pay more attention to leakages in the service delivery pipeline and feel empowered to propose solutions . <p> You ca n't change what you cant see . The power to know plus the power to act on what you know is the surest way to achieve positive social change from the bottom up . And when we consider the magnitude of resources invested in delivering public services each year , a 10% improvement globally would exceed the value of all foreign aid . We believe that is a bet worth making . <h> Friday 10/10/2008 11:58:00 AM <p> This week the Wildlife Conservation Society ( WCS ) released a report , The Deadly Dozen : Wildlife Diseases in the Age of Climate Change , which lists 12 pathogens ( including Avian Influenza , Cholera , Ebola , Lyme Disease , and Yellow fever ) that are expected to spread as a result of continued climate change . WCS highlights that the spread of this deadly dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cascading effects on the global economy . But , the report does not leave us in the dead zone . It points to how monitoring wildlife and the ecosystems in which they live can help us to manage these emergent human health threats . <p> This report , which draws from a new book , is just one of a series of new interdisciplinary studies ( others can be found here , here , and here ) that call for more proactive and holistic ( " One Health " ) approaches to management of emerging infectious diseases . " One Health " integrates human , animal and ecosystem health . <p> We are beginning to see public health training and disease management programs integrate animal health ( often with a focus on livestock ) into their plans . However , much less action has been taken to integrate ecosystem factors into disease management . This is not surprising given that integrating animal health into the human public health systems , although a large step institutionally , is a relatively small step conceptually . Many of the same tools and methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as surveillance , vaccination , and laboratory diagnostics . <p> In contrasts , linking ecosystem health including wildlife and wildlands-- and the risks of regional and global environmental change with the public health system requires a large conceptual leap . Traditionally , " environmental health " focuses on managing the health implications of pollution , toxics and occupational health . However , the environmental changes we are experiencing today , such as climate change , deforestation and biodiversity loss are fundamentally different types of problems . They entail disruptive systemic changes in underlying function of the systems . Managing the health implications of these systematic changes such as WCSs Deadly Dozen will require the conceptual leap of transforming our public health infrastructure to a one health infrastructure . <h> Thursday 10/09/2008 05:22:00 PM <p> When I arrived in Dar es Salaam , I was greeted with a warm smile and a " Karibu sana " -- " You are welcomed " in Swahili -- that set the tone for my visit to Tanzania . <p> I attended the Annual General &amp; Scientific Meeting of the INDEPTH Network . INDEPTH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collecting data on nearly every aspect of the lives of a surveyed population -- on infectious disease , cause of deaths , migration , health service utilization , livelihood , reproductive health , and more -- across 37 sites in 19 countries in Africa , Asia , Central America and Oceania . For one of the surveillance site in Matlab , a rural area about 70 kilometres southeast of Dhaka the capital of Bangladesh , data collection has been taking place for over 40 years now . Data has been used to evaluate disease patterns and trends and also to test health interventions . In total , 2.2 million people every year are being monitored -- this provides required health and demographic data that enable developing countries to set evidence-based health priorities and policies . <p> Not surprisingly , data sharing within and across field sites and countries presents significant challenges to data management due to uncertainty in data access , poor metadata , and disparate data quality standards . Some of these issues and challenges were discussed during a session on technological innovations . Of particular interest was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis within and across sites in Burkina Faso , India , Papua New Guinea , Tanzania , and Thailand . We also learned about projects in Uganda and Bangladesh piloting the use of mobile survey software for data collection one of the sites was collecting 29,000 forms a year . Another point that piqued my interest was the concept of a " Health System Observatory " operating at different levels that would foster research discovery , innovation , and interactions between researchers , policy-makers , and other communities . <p> A concrete next step for me is to explore the possibility of leveraging INDEPTH capabilities to investigate the impact of ecology , climate , and socioeconomic change on the transmission of infectious diseases for more targeted control activities at local level . <h> Wednesday 10/01/2008 10:33:00 AM <p> Right now the U.S. has a very real opportunity to transform our economy from one running on fossil fuels to one largely based on clean energy . We are developing the technologies and know-how to accomplish this . We can build whole new industries and create millions of new jobs . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at home . We can improve our national security . And we can put a big dent in climate change . With strong leadership we could be moving forward on an aggressive but realistic timeline and an approach that balances costs with real economic gains . <p> The energy team at Google has been crunching the numbers to see how we could greatly reduce fossil fuel use by 2030 . Our analysis , led by Jeffery Greenblatt , suggests a potential path to weaning the U.S. off of coal and oil for electricity generation by 2030 ( with some remaining use of natural gas as well as nuclear ) , and cutting oil use for cars by 40% . Al Gore has issued a challenge that is even more ambitious , getting us to carbon-free electricity even sooner . We hope the American public pushes our leaders to embrace it . T. Boone Pickens has weighed in with an interesting plan of his own to massively deploy wind energy , among other things . Other plans have also been developed in recent years that merit attention . <p> Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2030 proposal is to stimulate debate and we invite you to take a look and comment - or offer an alternative approach if you disagree . With a new Administration and Congress - and multiple energy-related imperatives - this is an opportune , perhaps unprecedented , moment to move from plan to action . <p> Over 22 years this plan could generate billions of dollars in savings and help create millions of green jobs . Many of these high quality , good-paying jobs will be in today 's coal and oil producing states . <p> To get there we need immediate action on three fronts : <p> ( 1 ) Reduce demand by doing more with less <p> We should start with the low-hanging fruit by reducing energy demand through energy efficiency -- adopting technologies and practices that allow us to do more with less . At Google , we 've seen the benefits of this approach . We identified $5M in building efficiency investments with a 2.5 year payback . We 've also designed our own data centers to run more efficiently , and we believe they are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , personal computers can also become much more efficient . A typical desktop PC wastes nearly half the power it consumes . Last year , Bill Weihl , our Green Energy Czar , worked with industry partners to create the Climate Savers Computing Initiative to raise energy efficiency standards for personal computers and servers . If we meet our goals , these standards will cut energy consumption by the equivalent of 10-20 coal-fired power plants by 2010 . <p> Government can have a big impact on achieving greater efficiency . California 's aggressive building codes , efficiency standards and utility programs have helped the state keep per-capita energy use flat for years , while consumption in much of the rest of the country has grown significantly . Enacting similar policies at the national level would help even more . <p> We also need to give the American people opportunities to be more efficient . The way we buy electricity today is like going to a store without seeing prices : we pick what we want , and receive an unintelligible bill at the end of the month . When homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows that energy use typically drops . Google is looking at ways that we can use our information technology and our reach to help increase awareness and bring better , real-time information to consumers . <p> ( 2 ) Develop renewable energy that is cheaper than coal ( RE&lt;C ) <p> Googles data centers draw from a U.S. electricity grid that relies on coal for 50% of its power . We want to help catalyze the development of renewable energy that is price competitive with coal . At least three technologies show tremendous promise : wind , solar thermal , and advanced geothermal . Each of these is abundant and , when combined , could supply energy in virtually every region of the U.S. <p> This year Google has invested over $45 million in startup companies with breakthrough wind , solar and geothermal technologies through our Renewable Energy Cheaper than Coal ( RE&lt;C ) initiative , but that is a drop when we need a flood . We need to unleash massive private investment in clean energy . The government can have a big impact here as well . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid deployment and scaling of clean technologies such as long-term tax support and a national renewable energy standard . Tax credits for wind and solar have lapsed several times in the last 20 years , starving these nascent industries of the capital they need to truly enter the mainstream . <p> We also must work both sides of the RE&lt;C equation . Progress will be accelerated when the price of carbon reflects its true costs to society . Putting a price on carbon through cap-and-trade or a carbon tax would help address this . <p> ( 3 ) Electrify transportation and re-invent our electric grid <p> Imagine driving a car that uses no gas and is less expensive to recharge than buying a latte . A " smart grid " allows you to charge when electricity is cheap , and maybe even make some money by selling unused power back to the grid when it 's needed . Plug-in cars are on their way , with GM , Toyota and other manufacturers planning introductions in the next two years . At Google we have a small fleet of Toyota Prius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our RechargeIT program . The converted Prius plug-ins get over 90 MPG , and the Escapes close to 50 MPG . However to successfully put millions of plug-in cars on the road and and fuel them with green electricity , we need a smart grid that manages when we charge and how we 're billed . A smart grid could also provide for the two-way flow of electricity , as well as large-scale integration of intermittent solar and wind energy . Much of the technology in our current electrical grid was developed in the 60s and is wasteful and not very smart . We are partnering with GE to help accelerate the development of the smart grid and support building new transmission lines to harness our nation 's vast renewable energy resources . <p> We see a huge opportunity for the nation to confront our energy challenges . In the process we will stimulate investment , create jobs , empower consumers and , by the way , help address climate change .
