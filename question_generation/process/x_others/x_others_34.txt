When we looked at our internal data a few months ago we were particularly saddened , although not entirely surprised , to find that the countrys Internet bandwidth -- a critical component of any modern economy -- was radically lower than that of its close neighbors . <p> At the request of the Clinton Foundation , and with some input from external experts like Inveneo , we recently came up with some ideas for improving access to the Internet in Haiti and wrote them up in this paper ( . pdf ) . They include opening TV or other appropriate spectrum for use , as the FCC recently approved in the United States , and different possibilities for connecting to undersea cables that would help make easy , cheap broadband connectivity a reality for Haitians . <p> These are some ideas to start the discussion .

We believe a stronger Internet means a stronger economy and democracy , and we hope this discussion will help Haiti succeed . <h> Thursday 10/28/2010 09:10:00 AM <p> Many of the world 's smallest and most endangered languages have no written form and have never been recorded or scientifically documented . Today , the National Geographic Enduring Voices YouTube channel will launch and allow many of these tongues to have a presence on the Internet for the very first time . Linguists Dr. K. David Harrison and Dr. Gregory Anderson from the Living Tongues Institute have teamed up with Google.org to allow small and endangered languages that may have never been heard outside of a remote village to reach a global audience . Using YouTube as a platform , researchers , academics and communities can now collaborate more effectively on promoting language revitalization . <p> The launch of the channel comes on the heels of an announcement by Harrison and Anderson of a " hidden " language of India , known locally as Koro , that is new to science and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of half of the worlds languages likely to vanish in the next 100 years . <p> In the midst of a language extinction crisis , we are also seeing a global grassroots movement for language revitalization . Speakers are leveraging new technologies , such as social networking and YouTube , to sustain small languages . As Harrison describes in his book " The Last Speakers , " we are all impoverished when a language dies , and all enriched by the human knowledge base found in the world 's smallest tongues . <h> Tuesday 10/26/2010 10:10:00 AM <p> Journalism is fundamental to a functioning democracy . So as media organizations globally continue to broaden their presence online , were eager to play our part on the technology sideexperimenting with new ways of presenting news online ; providing tools like Google Maps and YouTube Direct to make websites more engaging for readers ; and investing heavily in our digital platforms to enable publishers to generate more revenue . <p> But while were mostly focused on working with news organizations to develop better products for users , we also believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's why were giving $5 million in grants to non-profit organizations that are working to develop new approaches to journalism in the digital age .

The other $1 million will augment the Knight News Challenge , which is accepting funding proposals from anyone , anywhere in the world , until December 1 .

SMU estimates that 2% of West Virginia 's geothermal resources could support over 18,890 megawatts of electrical generating capacity using Enhanced Geothermal Systems ( EGS ) and other advanced geothermal technologies such as Co-Produced Fluids and Low Temperature Hydrothermal . <p> The SMU team has been developing entirely new pictures of the earth 's geothermal resources . They have started by aggregating thousands of new Bottom Hole Temperature ( BHT ) temperature readings from oil , gas , and water wells in previously under-sampled regions of the U.S. For example , The 2004 Geothermal Map of North America featured only four temperature points informing geothermal estimates for West Virginia , compared to 1,455 points in the updated version .

Last night members of the Google.org team were delighted to celebrate the inaugural class of Global Health Corps Fellows as they assembled at the Stanford University School of Medicine before embarking on their year-long placements in Malawi , Tanzania , Rwanda , New Jersey , and Boston . The Fellows met for the first time during a two-week course to prepare them for their upcoming assignments . <p> The Global Health Corps concept was a product of some exciting brainstorming during the aids2031 conference hosted by Google.org in March 2008 . GHC 's 6-person leadership team includes Barbara Bush as President , and two Googlers , Charlie Hale and Andrew Bentley . " This has been an amazing collaborative effort . We 've had an incredible amount of support from a number of partners , and are confident this first class of fellows will have a tremendous impact , " says Charlie Hale . <p> The organization strives to improve the quality of health services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduates from Africa and America with health-focused non-profit organizations . <p> Angie Bengtson from Minnesota and Mweya Clement from Tanzania are a duo that will begin their one year assignment with SACIDs ( Southern African Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance ) in August .

Swine flu has quickly become a pandemic but is not yet very virulent . <p> We get many new infectious diseases from the animals we eat or live with - poultry , livestock , wildlife , or insects such as mosquitoes . Some diseases have been around for a long time but we know surprisingly little about them . Rift Valley Fever , for example , periodically kills people and livestock in east Africa , most recently in early 2007 when 300 people died in Kenya , Tanzania and Somalia .

@@13268996 @1868996/ <h> Monday 11/19/2012 02:53:00 PM <p> Inspiration comes in many shapes and forms . For U.S. Marine Sgt. Winston Fiore , it was a news article about the International Childrens Surgical Foundation ( ICSF ) and Dr. Geoff Williams , who provides free facial-reconstructive surgeries for children with cleft lips/palates in developing countries . Although cleft palates are quite correctable , if left untreated the deformity can cause serious health issues . Many children do n't  have the surgery because the cost of each procedure ( $250 USD ) is out of reach for their families . <p> Inspired to do something to help , Winston set out on a 5,000-mile trek across Southeast Asia to raise money and awareness for the ICSFa mission he dubbed Smile Trek . Armed with sturdy boots , a 20-pound vest carrying essentials and an Android phone with Google Maps , Winston set off on his mission in October 2011 . In the last year , he has walked ( yes , walked ! ) through Brunei , China , Laos , Malaysia , Philippines , Singapore , Taiwan , Thailand , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have contributed to his cause , whether it was a place to stay , a hot meal or a monetary donation on his website . <p> Trekking along : Winston , standing in front of a durian fruit stand near Sematan , the westernmost town of Malaysian Borneo <p> Out on the road , Winstons Android phone and Google Maps became " the hub " of his entire operation . He used Google Maps to find accurate and easy-to-use walking directions everywhere he went , whether it was through remote villages and farms , down tiny dirt roads , or across rice paddies and desolate sugar cane fields . " Walking directions in Google Maps were critical to my trek . The directions were accurate and efficientits essential to take the shortest route when you 're walking 20-25 miles each day , " said Winston . " But the best part was being routed onto roads and trails through areas I otherwise never would have discovered with , say , driving directions , or even a physical map . " <p> In addition to using Google Maps , Winston relied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used Google Latitude to keep his family , friends and supporters informed of his whereabouts , and MyTracks to record his speed , distance and the places he visited . He also used Google Translate to communicate with locals , and in one case found it essential : when bit by a stray dog outside of Bangkok , he typed " I got bit by a dog , can someone take me to a hospital ? " into his app . A taxi driver took him to the hospital , where he got 11 shots ! <p> Today , after walking 5,000 miles in 408 days , Sgt. Fiore completes his journey , with more than $65,000 raised for ICSF . The money will help to fund more than 200 life-saving surgeries for children in Southeast Asia and other parts of the world .
