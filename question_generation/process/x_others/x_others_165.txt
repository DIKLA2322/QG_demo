Decades later , Daryl Baldwin , a citizen of the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma , began teaching himself the language from historical manuscripts and now works with the Miami University in Ohio to continue the work of revitalizing the language , publishing stories , audio files and other educational materials . Miami children are once again learning the language andeven more inspiringteaching it to each other . Daryls work is just one example of the efforts being made to preserve and strengthen languages that are on the brink of disappearing . <p> Today were introducing something we hope will help : the Endangered Languages Project , a website for people to find and share the most up-to-date and comprehensive information about endangered languages . Documenting the 3,000+ languages that are on the verge of extinction ( about half of all languages in the world ) is an important step in preserving cultural diversity , honoring the knowledge of our elders and empowering our youth . Technology can strengthen these efforts by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last speakers of a language ) , connecting diaspora communities through social media and facilitating language learning . <p> The Endangered Languages Project , backed by a new coalition , the Alliance for Linguistic Diversity , gives those interested in preserving languages a place to store and access research , share advice and build collaborations . People can share their knowledge and research directly through the site and help keep the content up-to-date . A diverse group of collaborators have already begun to contribute content ranging from 18th-century manuscripts to modern teaching tools like video and audio language samples and knowledge-sharing articles . Members of the Advisory Committee have also provided guidance , helping shape the site and ensure that it addresses the interests and needs of language communities . <p> Google has played a role in the development and launch of this project , but the long-term goal is for true experts in the field of language preservation to take the lead . As such , in a few months well officially be handing over the reins to the First Peoples ' Cultural Council ( FPCC ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ List ) at Eastern Michigan University . FPCC will take on the role of Advisory Committee Chair , leading outreach and strategy for the project . The LINGUIST List will become the Technical Lead . Both organizations will work in coordination with the Advisory Committee . <p> As part of this project , research about the worlds most threatened languages is being shared by the Catalogue of Endangered Languages ( ELCat ) , led by teams at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and Eastern Michigan University , with funding provided by the National Science Foundation . Work on ELCat has only just begun , and were sharing it through our site so that feedback from language communities and scholars can be incorporated to update our knowledge about the worlds most at-risk languages . Building upon other efforts to preserve and promote culture online , Google.org has seeded this projects development . We invite interested organizations to join the effort . By bridging independent efforts from around the world we hope to make an important advancement in confronting language endangerment . This projects future will be decided by those inspired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope you 'll join us . <h> Thursday 6/14/2012 04:09:00 PM <p> Would you like to use your coding skills to significantly improve the world , and have the chance to win tickets to Google I/O 2013 for your efforts ? Google.org has joined forces with the I/O Extended team to bring you the " Develop for Good " Hackathon . Were looking for hackers to tackle issues around repressive regimes , engaging citizens in politics and enabling us all to be greener ! <p> Almost anyone can participate in the hackathon from just about anywhere in the world . Many of the Extended events are already hosting hackathons , so we encourage you to find an event near you or start your own . If you 're in the San Francisco Bay Area , Google.org will be hosting a Develop for Good hackathon at the San Francisco I/O Extended event . <p> Developers can start preparing , and even coding , right away and then bring their ideas to the Extended event Hackathons during I/O ( though we welcome you to participate even if you 're unable to attend an event ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11:59 p.m . ( PDT ) on June 29 , 2012 via this form . <p> After June 29th a team of Googlers will judge the submissions for each challenge . We will announce the winning hacks for each challenge by about August 1st , 2012 . There will be one winning hack selected from each challenge area , and each will receive up to 5 tickets to I/O 2013 , along with the honorary title of " Google Developer for Good , 2012 " . In addition , well award one of the latest Chromebooks to each member of the team producing the best web app across all three challenges . <p> If you are interested in getting involved , we recommend signing up for an I/O Extended event near you and then checking with the organizer to see whether a hackathon is part of the agendaor hosting your own Extended event and hackathon ! <p> Anna de Paula Hanika is a Product Marketing Manager on the Google.org team , currently focused on Google 's Green and Giving efforts , and all things related to using technology to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When natural disasters strike , more and more people around the world are turning to the web , social media and mobile technologies to connect with loved ones , locate food and shelter , find evacuation routes , access medical care and help those affected , near and far . <p> Over the past few years , we 've seen some powerful examples of technology helping people and organizations cope with disasters , including : <p> This is really only scratching the surface of the amazing things people are doing , and were only beginning to understand the potential . So were hosting a Big Tent event in Sendai , Japan on 2 July to explore the growing role of technology in preparing for , responding to and rebuilding from disasters . <p> At this day-long forum , through a series of panel discussions , keynotes and technology demos , we hope to learn from some of the leading local and global , public and private sector voices on managing crises . The day 's speakers will include : <p> We chose to host this event in Sendai - the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years Great East Japan Earthquake - to focus this forum on Japans impressive disaster response and recovery efforts , which demonstrated some new and innovative ways that technology can aid the efforts of responders to reduce the impact and cost of disasters . <p> While hard hit coastal areas remain bare , with only foundation lines to mark the many homes that have been lost , and too many families still living in shelters or temporary housing , central Sendai and much of the Tohoku region are beginning to buzz with new life and commerce as the community rebuilds . There is still a lot of work to be done , but weve already learned a great deal from this region and the inspiring response and rebuilding work being done by people in Japan and around the world , and we believe there 's much more for Google , public and private sector leaders , NGOs and technologists to gain by coming together here . <p> For those interested in joining us in Sendai , please register to attend here . Though space is limited , well accommodate as many of you as we can .
