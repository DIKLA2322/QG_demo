The significance of the infectious period: the entire period of the patient's discharge of pathogens is called the infectious period, which is an important basis for determining the duration of isolation of patients with infectious diseases, and to a certain extent, also affects the epidemiological characteristics of the disease.
The epidemiological characteristics of airborne infectious diseases: ① widespread transmission, high incidence ② high incidence in winter and spring ③ children and adolescents are more common ④ in the population without immunization, the incidence is cyclical ⑤ high incidence in areas with crowded housing and high population density.
The conditions for the elimination of the source of the epidemic: ① the source of infection is removed or no longer discharged pathogens ② through various measures to eliminate the source of infection discharged into the external environment ③ all susceptible contacts after the longest incubation period of the disease did not appear new cases or proved not infected.
