Working in more than 40 countries around the world , Mercy Corps believes that communities are the best agents of their own change and local markets are the best engines of long-term recovery . When disaster or emergency strikes , Mercy Corps puts bold solutions into action , helping people triumph over adversity and build stronger communities from within . <p> Mercy Corps receives support from organizations like Google and others to develop effective solutions to aid challenges . An example was during the European Refugee Crisis where Mercy Corps was responding to the needs of thousands of refugees traveling through Greece . A Google volunteer witnessed a Mercy Corps team member struggling to convey critical information to refugees because of language barriers and realized that a product that offered reliable translation assistance could help . @qwx162836 <p> Translation Cards is an open source Android app that helps field workers and refugees communicate more effectively and confidently . With the help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UNHCR to create the app . Translation Cards users can simply tap-and-play a flashcard for audio translations , allowing doctors , aid workers , and volunteers to communicate basic phrases in a listener 's native tongue . Cards can be pre-recorded or created on the fly , allowing for nimble exchanges . Moreover , the app does not run on a network , eliminating the need for an Internet connection . Besides conveying important information , the app also puts the human ' back into humanitarian work by affording a one-on-one , personalized exchange .

Their work in 190 countries has advocated for human basics like nutrition , protection from disaster or conflict , shelter , and equality . By protecting younger generations and the people raising them , UNICEF hopes to lay the foundation for a stronger , better world . <p> Recently , the Zika virus outbreak put thousands of mothers and infants at risk . Congenital and neurological conditions caused by Zika were found in newborns from 75 countries in Latin America , the Caribbean , Africa , and Asia . The number of cases is expected to continue to rise , especially in economically marginalized communities that lack access to prevention information and medical oversight. @qwx162836 <p> Google.org made a $1 million grant to support UNICEF 's efforts to create widespread awareness , reduce mosquito populations , and support the development of diagnostics and vaccines , and launched an employee donation campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PAHO ) . To bolster UNICEF 's existing prevention tactics Google.org 's Disaster Corps program dispatched a team of volunteer Google engineers , designers and data scientists to help build a platform that analyzes data such as weather or travel patterns in order to predict where the virus might hit next . Although the prototype is currently being applied to Zika , UNICEF intends to use it to study and fight future outbreaks of other diseases .
@@13268903 @1868903/ <h> Tuesday 10/29/2013 01:14:00 PM <p> When people get sick , they turn to the Web for information . Back in 2008 , a team at Google dug into this behavior and found that certain search terms were good indicators of flu levels . We later launched Google Flu Trends to estimate flu activity in near real-time using aggregated Google search data , in regions around the world . <p> At the end of every flu season , we evaluate the performance of our model . Are our estimates accurate ? What worked well , or not so well ? Do we need to make any updates ? After the 2009 H1N1 season , for example , we updated the model to make sure we were providing accurate estimates . Since 2009 , the model had performed well at the national and regional levels in the US and no update was needed . <p> Flu Trends can help estimate the start , peak , and duration of each flu season--all important information for public health agencies . During the 2012-2013 season in the US , the model performed well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , the model overestimated the severity of the flu . In January 2013 , after spotting the difference between our estimates and the percentage of healthcare visits for influenza-like illnesses ( ILI ) reported by the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) , we started to investigate the high estimates . We found that heightened media coverage on the severity of the flu season resulted in an extended period in which users were searching for terms we 've identified as correlated with flu levels . In early 2013 , we saw more flu-related searches in the US than ever before . <p> We evaluated several options to improve the model . Ultimately , we determined that an update using the peak from the 2012-2013 season provided a close approximation of flu activity for recent seasons . We will be applying this update to the US flu level estimates for the 2013-2014 flu season , starting from August 1st . A casual observer will see that the new model forecasts a lower flu level than last years model did at a similar time in the season . We believe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can check out the new models estimates against previous years flu levels in this graph : <p> For those of you who want more data and details , we presented this paper recently at the ISNTD Bites conference . This is an iterative process . We will keep exploring how we can build resilience to accommodate the effect of news media . In the meantime , stay healthy !
