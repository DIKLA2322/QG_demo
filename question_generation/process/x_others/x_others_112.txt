Health belongs in the climate change discussion , and we 're glad WHO and its member countries are using today to bring the linkage to the forefront . <p> Climates effects on health are wide reaching . Climate affects the quality of air we breathe and the quantity and quality of water resources . It affects the productivity of agriculture , distribution of pests and disease , and the severity and frequency of heatwaves , droughts , floods , and wildfires . As a result , climate change is not just an environmental issue but fundamentally a human health and livelihoods issue . <p> We are already experiencing the impacts of climate change across the globe . In fact , a WHO report concluded the climate changes since the mid-1970s may have caused about 150,000 deaths in 2000 . The impacts of climate change are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Change in WHO estimated mortality per year ( per million people ) attributable to climate change by the year 2000 . This map is based on WHO data for climate-sensitive health outcomes including : cardiovascular diseases , diarrhea , malaria , inland and coastal flooding , and malnutrition . Learn more about the link of climate and health . <p> The global community is just beginning to understand the impact that continued climate change is likely to have on the distribution of infectious diseases . Check out the post by our mapping specialists where they describe the Google Earth layers they developed with scientists researching the affects climate may have on dengue and malaria transmission . You can also download these Google Earth layers here . <p> While some climate change impacts on public health and the environment are now unavoidable due to our past emissions of greenhouse gases , the severity of the impacts will depend on actions we take today to both reduce future emissions and prepare for the changes ahead . At Google.org we are working to reduce greenhouse gas emission by developing utility-scale renewable energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the RechargeIT initiative , while the Predict and Prevent initiative team is working to help prepare the world 's poor to manage the rising number emerging infectious diseases in our rapidly changing world .
