@@13269030 @1869030/ <h> Friday 10/31/2008 02:17:00 PM <p> At Google.org , we have met and worked with many amazing organizations over the past few years , and we keep hearing how eager people are to use online mapping tools such as Google Earth and Google Maps to tell their stories . There are tons of great mapping ideas out there , and we think that with a little support , many of them can come to life . So today , were excited to launch Google.org Geo Challenge Grants , a small grants program to provide nonprofits with the impetus and resources they need to take advantage of powerful and exciting online mapping tools . <p> Maps are a powerful way for organizations to display and share data , promote ideas and issues , and plan and organize activities . Online mapping tools can help the world visualize and understand information , problems , and solutions - whether in your town or village , or across the globe . They provide an easy-to-use interface with lots of detailed satellite imagery and other background data to put it all in context . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to advance their work in the areas of global development , climate change and global public health . Together with the Google Earth Outreach team , we piloted the program with a small number of organizations , asking what kind of online mapping work could you do with a small grant ? Every organization suggested a project that shares unique and useful information and tells a powerful story . Here is an example : <p> The Dreaming New Mexico initiative seeks to encourage adoption of clean electricity and to move New Mexico away from dirty , polluting power plants . Using the Google Earth API ( browser plug-in ) , Dreaming New Mexico shows some of the choices available to New Mexico as it considers a move to sustainable clean energy . Click here to view the site . <p> We 're now accepting applications from non-profit organizations around the world ! Use your imagination and remember that many online mapping tools can be easy to learn and intuitive to use . Our first round of applications is open today and will close on December 22 . We hope to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10/28/2008 06:18:00 PM <p> On October 11th , nearly 200 people convened at Google for the first BarCamp Africa with the purpose of " building the conversation between people and opportunities in Silicon Valley and Africa . " With Google as Hosting Sponsor , this volunteer-run event gathered a wide array of technologists , philanthropists , bloggers , artists and entrepreneurs , more than 20 not-for-profit organizations , and subject matter experts from across the Bay Area and as far as Rwanda , Kenya , South Africa and Uganda . <p> First conceived by Ellen Petry Leanse and Kaushal Jhalla , two Bay Area residents with deep roots in Africa , BarCamp Africa provided the unique opportunity to bring together Africa-focused professionals from Silicon Valley with people from , and doing important work in , Africa . With an emphasis on user-generated content and spontaneous connections , BarCamp Africa let participants to shape the agenda , and provided the space for creativity and idea sharing . As with other BarCamp events held in Nairobi and Kampala earlier this year , Google has helped connect the African technology community with other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could make a difference in the region , through technology and innovation . <p> Topics discussed during the days event included emerging technologies , mobile phone growth and opportunities , social innovation and entrepreneurship . Highlights included : <p> The need to focus on supporting entrepreneurship and business growth <p> The importance of investing in local talent <p> The opportunity to promote innovation as the key driver of industry growth and job creation <p> The importance of helping strengthen connection to community for disadvantaged students with strong potential so that they do not lose roots ( diaspora challenge ) <p> How giving back to the community provides girls who have received assistance ( scholarship support , mentoring , etc. ) with self-esteem , and the feeling that they can accomplish great things because of the experience of doing so <p> The role of economic development that drives choice and support for women 's empowerment <p> A number of new initiatives emerged as a direct result of BarCamp Africa , including : <p> the founding of Reaspora.com , a web destination focused on resources , connections and support for African expatriates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this website and the commitment to build it grew directly from connections made at BarCamp Africa <p> the creation of SquibWib , a web-based educational platform that allows a mentor and a student in different places to meet online and read together , as if they were in the same room <p> the establishment of Afridex , the first steps of a consolidator of pan-African tech content <p> the launch of Kelele , an annual bloggers ' conference that will move between African countries ; the wide response to BarCamp Africa inspired a coalition of African bloggers to commit to this ongoing gathering <p> the building of connections between Silicon Valley 's community of not-for-profits focused on positive change in Africa ; these groups have already begun to support one another at local gatherings and events . <p> With the help of sponsorship from Google.org , five attendees from outside of the United States were able to join the group to represent the NGO sector , whose efforts ranged from education to conservation and web development . A number of sponsors and individual participants contributed generously , including Humanity United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inform and Empower initiative lies in the access to timely , relevant information that can empower government leaders and citizens to improve the delivery of vital public services . So I was delighted to hear that yesterday one of our grantees , Pratham-ASER , was a gold winner of the 2008 Excellence in Information Integrity award in the non-profit category . <p> The EII Awards Program recognizes organizations that have made significant progress - through a single project or an enterprise-wide effort - towards achieving Information Integrity - the accuracy , consistency and reliability of the information content , process and system . Given that ASER is one of the few organizations collecting data on basic literacy and numeracy across rural India , it is extremely important that their data is accurate . How exciting to see our grantee get international recognition for their efforts ! <h> 10/21/2008 04:48:00 PM <p> A number of us at Google.org have been gleefully contributing to the spread of the Girl Effect video . Maybe you have seen this powerful and moving video already . This piece of art and social commerce , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the education and empowerment of girls , has gone viral and has been featured on a number of interesting blogs ( including blogher and Made to Stick ) . <p> We really admire a couple of things about this video-- how it has been used to define a complex issue in accessible terms , kick start an important conversation , and complement the announcement by the Nike Foundation and NoVo Foundation of their giving strategy , which focuses on improving the lives of girls in poor countries . We are also interested in understanding what comes next . <p> What has seeing this video prompted you to do ? Where will the conversation go from here ? <h> Monday 10/20/2008 11:40:00 PM <p> In January we announced Predict and Prevent , Google.org 's global public health initiative that aims to help prevent the next pandemic . Since then our team has traveled far and wide to meet with partners , particularly in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa . We convened a workshop with the world 's experts on emerging infectious diseases in March , sponsored a meeting of climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workshops and conferences . <p> We 're excited today about an initial $14.8 million in funding for partners working on genetic and digital detection . To learn more about our partners , see our announcement or download this Google Earth layer which highlights the details of their work . For example , check out Healthmap and ProMED-mail 's expanded disease-tracking tools in Thailand : <p> Predict and Prevent has adopted a " one health " approach integrating human , animal and environmental health . We focus on knowing where to look for outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases , detecting those outbreaks through digital and genetic approaches , and supporting early warning and quick response . Our partners ' activities range from the use of environmental information to help health experts improve disease surveillance , to monitoring viral chatter and enhancing pathogen discovery , to strengthening networks for online disease outbreak reporting . These grants will increase our understanding of emerging infectious diseases and generate vasts amount of data , samples , sequences , and hopefully discoveries . <p> Our next step in putting this new knowledge to work to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease diagnostics for use in Asia and Africa . We 're working to find ways Google 's data management , data sharing , and collaboration platforms can improve information access and sharing , support online bioinformatics , and develop genetic maps of infectious diseases . Finally , we 're looking to work with partners on front lines of disease emergence in hot spot countries . In short , we are very excited about the grants we announced today , but we know we have our work cut out for us - watch this space ! <h> 10/20/2008 03:47:00 PM <p> Google.org has given the U.S. National Academies a grant for $250,000 to develop recommendations for U.S.-Chinese cooperation on renewable electricity . The 18-month study is being funded in collaboration with other U.S. sponsors and the Chinese Academies of Sciences and Engineering . <p> The study has three goals : <p> Assess the resource potential in China and the U.S. for grid-scale electricity generation <p> Explore near-term market opportunities for mature technologies <p> Recommend priorities for enhanced collaboration , with a focus on cost reduction , improved efficiency and grid connectivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their relevant agencies/ministries , and private industries assign priorities for meaningful cooperation in developing and utilizing electricity from renewable energy . <p> By focusing on grid-scale electricity generation , the study will give special attention to three major resources : wind , solar , and biomass . It will also consider technologies with longer time horizons , such as enhanced geothermal systems ( EGS ) . It will build on a current U.S. National Academies study , which is assessing the technology risks and tradeoffs for various energy technologies . An understanding of the geographic , technical , and economic constraints will help guide Chinese decision makers to develop appropriate strategies to sustainably meet their energy needs . Chinas manufacturing prowess , combined with its growing domestic market , provide opportunities to accelerate progress and reduce costs for renewable energy technologies . <p> The U.S. and China represent the world 's two largest consumers of energy . Getting renewable electricity right for both countries will be a significant step to decelerating global climate change . <h> Friday 10/17/2008 01:35:00 PM <p> Last month , Google.org invited the non-profits attending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to improve their operations and enhance their websites . Romanus Berg from Ashoka moderated the session and Suzanne DiBianca and others from Salesforce talked about how non-profits can take advantage of the powerful integration between Salesforce and Google Apps . After a high-level plenary session , the 75 organizations in attendance participated in breakout sessions focused on technology solutions for improving internal efficiency , optimizing websites and harnessing the power of online video . <p> We also took advantage of the occasion to announce a refresh of our Google for Non-Profits site , now more streamlined and with a greater focus on training videos . Where appropriate , the groups in attendance were also given the opportunity to work with Google over the next several months to implement the ideas and strategies that work best for them . <h> Wednesday 10/15/2008 01:45:00 PM <p> Today is Blog Action Day , an annual event that rallies blogs around the world to post about a common cause . This year 's issue up for discussion is poverty , so we wanted to take a look at the relationship between access to information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right time in the hands of people has enormous power . As someone who works for Google , I see evidence of this everyday as people search and find information they need to create knowledge , grow their business , or access essential services . But that applies primarily to the rich world , where economies are built on knowledge and presume access to information . What about the poor and developing countries where people are offline more than online ? How do they benefit from the power of information ? <p> In much of Sub-Saharan Africa , for example , rates of economic growth over the last decade have exceeded 5% every year . Despite this trend , poverty in many countries has remained constant . In Kenya , for example , the official poverty rate was 48% in 1981 . According to the Kenya Poverty and Inequality Assessment released by the World Bank this year , 17 million Kenyans or 47% of the population were unable to meet the costs of food sufficient to fulfill basic daily caloric requirements . The vast majority of these people live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information that impacts their daily life . Data on water quality , education and health budgets , and agricultural prices are nearly impossible to access . <p> Despite hundreds of millions of dollars spent each year on providing basic public services like primary education , health , water , and sanitation to poor communities , poverty in much of Sub-Saharan Africa persists . Where does this money go , who gets it , and what are the results of the resources invested ? That 's where we find a big black hole of information and a lack of basic accountability . How do inputs ( dollars spent ) turn into outputs ( schools , clinics , and wells ) , and , more importantly , how do outputs translate into results ( literate and healthy children , clean water , etc . ) ? <p> We simply do n't  know the answers to most of these basic questions . But what if we could ? What if a mother could find out how much money was budgeted for her daughter 's school each year and how much of it was received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often teachers are absent from school or whether health clinics have the medicines they are supposed to carry ? What if citizens could access and report on basic information to determine value for money as tax payers ? <p> The work of SODNET in Kenya is illustrative . They are developing a simple budget-tracking tool that allows citizens to track the allocation , use , and ultimate result of government funds earmarked for infrastructure projects in their districts . The tool is intended to create transparency in the use of tax revenues and answer the simple question : Are resources reaching their intended beneficiaries ? Using tools like maps , they are able to overlay information that begins to tell a compelling story . <p> Google.orgs role , through our partners in East Africa and India , is to support , catalyze , and widely disseminate this kind of information to public , private , and civil society stakeholders that can use it to see more clearly what 's working , what 's broken and what are potential solutions . Leveraging platforms like Google Earth and Google Maps can help organizations disseminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was once invisible . Once information is visible , widely known , and easy to understand , we are betting that governments and citizens will pay more attention to leakages in the service delivery pipeline and feel empowered to propose solutions . <p> You ca n't change what you cant see . The power to know plus the power to act on what you know is the surest way to achieve positive social change from the bottom up . And when we consider the magnitude of resources invested in delivering public services each year , a 10% improvement globally would exceed the value of all foreign aid . We believe that is a bet worth making . <h> Friday 10/10/2008 11:58:00 AM <p> This week the Wildlife Conservation Society ( WCS ) released a report , The Deadly Dozen : Wildlife Diseases in the Age of Climate Change , which lists 12 pathogens ( including Avian Influenza , Cholera , Ebola , Lyme Disease , and Yellow fever ) that are expected to spread as a result of continued climate change . WCS highlights that the spread of this deadly dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cascading effects on the global economy . But , the report does not leave us in the dead zone . It points to how monitoring wildlife and the ecosystems in which they live can help us to manage these emergent human health threats . <p> This report , which draws from a new book , is just one of a series of new interdisciplinary studies ( others can be found here , here , and here ) that call for more proactive and holistic ( " One Health " ) approaches to management of emerging infectious diseases . " One Health " integrates human , animal and ecosystem health . <p> We are beginning to see public health training and disease management programs integrate animal health ( often with a focus on livestock ) into their plans . However , much less action has been taken to integrate ecosystem factors into disease management . This is not surprising given that integrating animal health into the human public health systems , although a large step institutionally , is a relatively small step conceptually . Many of the same tools and methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as surveillance , vaccination , and laboratory diagnostics . <p> In contrasts , linking ecosystem health including wildlife and wildlands-- and the risks of regional and global environmental change with the public health system requires a large conceptual leap . Traditionally , " environmental health " focuses on managing the health implications of pollution , toxics and occupational health . However , the environmental changes we are experiencing today , such as climate change , deforestation and biodiversity loss are fundamentally different types of problems . They entail disruptive systemic changes in underlying function of the systems . Managing the health implications of these systematic changes such as WCSs Deadly Dozen will require the conceptual leap of transforming our public health infrastructure to a one health infrastructure . <h> Thursday 10/09/2008 05:22:00 PM <p> When I arrived in Dar es Salaam , I was greeted with a warm smile and a " Karibu sana " -- " You are welcomed " in Swahili -- that set the tone for my visit to Tanzania . <p> I attended the Annual General &amp; Scientific Meeting of the INDEPTH Network . INDEPTH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collecting data on nearly every aspect of the lives of a surveyed population -- on infectious disease , cause of deaths , migration , health service utilization , livelihood , reproductive health , and more -- across 37 sites in 19 countries in Africa , Asia , Central America and Oceania . For one of the surveillance site in Matlab , a rural area about 70 kilometres southeast of Dhaka the capital of Bangladesh , data collection has been taking place for over 40 years now . Data has been used to evaluate disease patterns and trends and also to test health interventions . In total , 2.2 million people every year are being monitored -- this provides required health and demographic data that enable developing countries to set evidence-based health priorities and policies . <p> Not surprisingly , data sharing within and across field sites and countries presents significant challenges to data management due to uncertainty in data access , poor metadata , and disparate data quality standards . Some of these issues and challenges were discussed during a session on technological innovations . Of particular interest was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis within and across sites in Burkina Faso , India , Papua New Guinea , Tanzania , and Thailand . We also learned about projects in Uganda and Bangladesh piloting the use of mobile survey software for data collection one of the sites was collecting 29,000 forms a year . Another point that piqued my interest was the concept of a " Health System Observatory " operating at different levels that would foster research discovery , innovation , and interactions between researchers , policy-makers , and other communities . <p> A concrete next step for me is to explore the possibility of leveraging INDEPTH capabilities to investigate the impact of ecology , climate , and socioeconomic change on the transmission of infectious diseases for more targeted control activities at local level . <h> Wednesday 10/01/2008 10:33:00 AM <p> Right now the U.S. has a very real opportunity to transform our economy from one running on fossil fuels to one largely based on clean energy . We are developing the technologies and know-how to accomplish this . We can build whole new industries and create millions of new jobs . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at home . We can improve our national security . And we can put a big dent in climate change . With strong leadership we could be moving forward on an aggressive but realistic timeline and an approach that balances costs with real economic gains . <p> The energy team at Google has been crunching the numbers to see how we could greatly reduce fossil fuel use by 2030 . Our analysis , led by Jeffery Greenblatt , suggests a potential path to weaning the U.S. off of coal and oil for electricity generation by 2030 ( with some remaining use of natural gas as well as nuclear ) , and cutting oil use for cars by 40% . Al Gore has issued a challenge that is even more ambitious , getting us to carbon-free electricity even sooner . We hope the American public pushes our leaders to embrace it . T. Boone Pickens has weighed in with an interesting plan of his own to massively deploy wind energy , among other things . Other plans have also been developed in recent years that merit attention . <p> Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2030 proposal is to stimulate debate and we invite you to take a look and comment - or offer an alternative approach if you disagree . With a new Administration and Congress - and multiple energy-related imperatives - this is an opportune , perhaps unprecedented , moment to move from plan to action . <p> Over 22 years this plan could generate billions of dollars in savings and help create millions of green jobs . Many of these high quality , good-paying jobs will be in today 's coal and oil producing states . <p> To get there we need immediate action on three fronts : <p> ( 1 ) Reduce demand by doing more with less <p> We should start with the low-hanging fruit by reducing energy demand through energy efficiency -- adopting technologies and practices that allow us to do more with less . At Google , we 've seen the benefits of this approach . We identified $5M in building efficiency investments with a 2.5 year payback . We 've also designed our own data centers to run more efficiently , and we believe they are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , personal computers can also become much more efficient . A typical desktop PC wastes nearly half the power it consumes . Last year , Bill Weihl , our Green Energy Czar , worked with industry partners to create the Climate Savers Computing Initiative to raise energy efficiency standards for personal computers and servers . If we meet our goals , these standards will cut energy consumption by the equivalent of 10-20 coal-fired power plants by 2010 . <p> Government can have a big impact on achieving greater efficiency . California 's aggressive building codes , efficiency standards and utility programs have helped the state keep per-capita energy use flat for years , while consumption in much of the rest of the country has grown significantly . Enacting similar policies at the national level would help even more . <p> We also need to give the American people opportunities to be more efficient . The way we buy electricity today is like going to a store without seeing prices : we pick what we want , and receive an unintelligible bill at the end of the month . When homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows that energy use typically drops . Google is looking at ways that we can use our information technology and our reach to help increase awareness and bring better , real-time information to consumers . <p> ( 2 ) Develop renewable energy that is cheaper than coal ( RE&lt;C ) <p> Googles data centers draw from a U.S. electricity grid that relies on coal for 50% of its power . We want to help catalyze the development of renewable energy that is price competitive with coal . At least three technologies show tremendous promise : wind , solar thermal , and advanced geothermal . Each of these is abundant and , when combined , could supply energy in virtually every region of the U.S. <p> This year Google has invested over $45 million in startup companies with breakthrough wind , solar and geothermal technologies through our Renewable Energy Cheaper than Coal ( RE&lt;C ) initiative , but that is a drop when we need a flood . We need to unleash massive private investment in clean energy . The government can have a big impact here as well . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid deployment and scaling of clean technologies such as long-term tax support and a national renewable energy standard . Tax credits for wind and solar have lapsed several times in the last 20 years , starving these nascent industries of the capital they need to truly enter the mainstream . <p> We also must work both sides of the RE&lt;C equation . Progress will be accelerated when the price of carbon reflects its true costs to society . Putting a price on carbon through cap-and-trade or a carbon tax would help address this . <p> ( 3 ) Electrify transportation and re-invent our electric grid <p> Imagine driving a car that uses no gas and is less expensive to recharge than buying a latte . A " smart grid " allows you to charge when electricity is cheap , and maybe even make some money by selling unused power back to the grid when it 's needed . Plug-in cars are on their way , with GM , Toyota and other manufacturers planning introductions in the next two years . At Google we have a small fleet of Toyota Prius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our RechargeIT program . The converted Prius plug-ins get over 90 MPG , and the Escapes close to 50 MPG . However to successfully put millions of plug-in cars on the road and and fuel them with green electricity , we need a smart grid that manages when we charge and how we 're billed . A smart grid could also provide for the two-way flow of electricity , as well as large-scale integration of intermittent solar and wind energy . Much of the technology in our current electrical grid was developed in the 60s and is wasteful and not very smart . We are partnering with GE to help accelerate the development of the smart grid and support building new transmission lines to harness our nation 's vast renewable energy resources . <p> We see a huge opportunity for the nation to confront our energy challenges . In the process we will stimulate investment , create jobs , empower consumers and , by the way , help address climate change .
